### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:
* IAR projects are not supported in this release

* SAM9X60/SAMA5D2 MPLABX demos regeneration should **NOT** overwrite the mpfs_net_img.c file.
    - The symbols used in this automatically generated file are not present in the project.

* wolfSSL/wolfCrypto PIC32M projects should be built with xc32 version >= 3.01.
    - Otherwise the build will fail.

* HTTP_NET projects using https with wolfSSL/wolfCrypt need to use xc32 v3.01.
    - A crash occurrs with xc32 v4.0 for PIC32MZ, SAME54.
    - Issue is under investigation.

* HTTP_NET FreeRTOS demos need a heap size of 200K when using the XC32 v4.0.0 compiler.

* SAMA5D2 MPLABX demos should **NOT** overwrite the linker script ddr.ld when regenerated.
    - Otherwise the GMAC descriptors: gmac_dcpt_array will not be placed in the '.region_nocache'

* SAMA5D2 projects should be built with -O0 optimization and at least 16 descriptors.
    - Higher optimization may cause GMAC driver lock up.
    - Investigation is in progress.

* The SAM9x60 MPLABX should **NOT** overwrite the linker script ddram.ld when regenerated.
    - Otherwise the EMAC descriptors: EMAC0_DcptArray will not be placed in the '.region_nocache'

* wolfMQTT demos need to have the file third_party/wolfMQTT/mqtt_socket.c built without xc32 option 'Make warnings into errors'
    - That is because it uses the obsolete #include <sys/errno.h>
    - Applies to PIC32MZ, SAME70, SAMV71 platforms

* Net Plugin issues:
    - Issue 1: The connection between MAC and NETCONFIG is missing in MCC project graph.
        - This happens for Net demos not migrated to TCP/IP Configurator. This issue will not impact code regeneration.
        - Reason: The MAC components updated for multi-capability support (MH3-52292). 
        - Workaround: Open the project graph in MCC. Open 'TCP/IP Configuration' from Plugins drop-down menu. Go to 'Data Link' Layer. Connect nodes between NETCONFIG and MAC.

    - Issue 2: Cannot remove dependency node on group-box once added.
        - This issue happens when multiple instances of external ethernet controller are added to project and one instance is removed later
        - Reason: New python interface API needed (CFW-1183) 
        - Workaround: No work around available

    - Issue 3: While starting the TCP/IP demo projects, the Number of Instances Using UART field in SYS_CONSOLE shows value 2.
        - This happens when only one UART is connected to SYS_CONSOLE, and the above field should be 1.
        - Reason: Under investigation
        - Workaround: Remove SYS_CONSOLE from project graph. Add the SYS_CONSOLE back to project graph. Connect the dependencies.

* Stack down/up issues:
    - When using xc32 v4.00 there is the possibility that executing the sequence stack down and then up, the stack up fails because of an allocation error.
    - This occurs even if the stack down was successful and all the memory was released.
    - The issue is currently under investigation.
    - Use xc32 v3.01 as a workaround.

- **New features**

The following table provides the list of the new features included in this release:

| Module                | Description                          |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ethernet PHY driver   | Added support for KSZ8041, KSZ8863, LAN8700, LAN8720, LAN9303, DP83640, DP83848, IP101GR |
| Ethernet MAC driver   | Added support for  ENC24xJ600 and ENC28J60 controllers|
| TCP/IP MHC            | Added TCP/IP Stack heap estimation in MHC configuration|
| TCP/IP MHC            | MQTT_NET Glue code is now optional|
| TCP/IP MHC            | MHC Network configuration flags updated to allow all the possible combinations|
| TCP                   | Changed the TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT default value to 0|
| TCP, NET_PRES         | Added API to indicate remote party disconnect (FIN)|
| FTP                   | Added FTP server run time authentication|
| TCP Demos             | Updated all the TCP demos to specifically check for the remote party sending FIN |
| MQTT Demo             | Added MQTT ping command |
| MPFS Utility          | mpfs.jar renamed to mpfs_net.jar| 
| MPFS Utility          | mpfs_net.jar utility will generate a MPFS_Net_SettingDetails.xml file for the configuration backup | 

- **Updated Applications**

    - All applications have been regenerated and tested to work with the latest repositories the TCP/IP stack depends on: core, csp, crypto, etc.

    - The TCP TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT default value is now 0.
        - This means that the sockets do not close themselves when receiving a FIN from the remote node.
        - The socket owner needs to actively close the socket.
        - The TCPIP_TCP_WasDisconnected() and NET_PRES_SocketWasDisconnected() APIs were added for support.
        - The TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT is marked as obsolete and will be eventually removed. However the application can still use it for now with a value != 0 if needed.

### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* SYS_DEBUG module needs to be removed in demos with external Ethernet controllers ENCx24J600 and ENC28J60:
    - This is due to DRV_SPI_TransferStatusGet() function returning "Transfer Handle Expired"

* When migrating a project from Net v3.5.1 to v3.6.0, the user may need to remove the "FILE SYSTEM" component from the project graph and then add it back to solve build issues

* wolfMQTT MHC configuration:
    - In 'wolfMQTT Library Configuration' when checking the 'Enable MQTT TLS' the generated code will fail build because missing of 'wolfSSL/options.h' file.
    - This file is not currently generated for wolfSSL and needs to be added manually

* web_net_server_qspi_mpfs on sam_a5d2_xult:
    - Run time exceptions occur after running the application for a while
    - This issue is currently under investigation

* web_net_server_sdcard_fatfs on sam_9x60_ek:
    - The HTTP access to the files and the HTTP connection is very slow
    - This issue is currently under investigation

* web_ftp_server_usb_fatfs on sam_e54_sk and sam_e54_sk_freertos:
    - DFP pack needs to be updated for these demos and SAME54_DFP v3.3.64 should be used

* For the TCP/IP demos using dual file system with SDMMC and NVM (web_ftp_server_mpfs_fatfs project for example):
    - A run time issue can occur when HTTP asks for a file status: the SYS_FS call can fail
    - The workaround is to have DRV_MEMORY_Initialize() (used by MPFS) called before the the call to DRV_SDSPI_Initialize() call (used by the FAT FS)
    - The mount of MPFS should be done before the FAT FS mount.
    - This is a known SYS_FS issue which will be solved in a future release.

* The DHCP server module does not handle well the initialization data on multiple interfaces
    - A run time exception can occur when using the DHCP server on multiple interfaces.

* wolfSSL code using the PIC32MZ crypto engine does not work correctly
    - PIC32MZ hardware crypto should not be selected in MHC
    - This is a known issue that is taken care of in a newer wolfSSL release.

* SAM9X60 driver corrupted RX packets may occur:
    - For RX packets that span more than one descriptor (i.e. packet size > 128 bytes) data corruption may occur.
    - Some packets may be reported as having wrong checksum and discarded.
    - This issue is under investigation and will be solved in a future release.

Older known issues:

* When creating an IAR project with MHC for the SAME54 Xplained Pro platform the following extra step is needed:
    - Add '\_\_PIC32C\_\_' in  project options-> c/c++ compiler -> preprocessor-> Defined symbols

* For PIC32MX projects on the Ethernet Stater Kit II:
    - PIC32MX device supports only the core timer. If other timer is selected there will be MHC errors during the demo generation.
    - Ethernet Starter Kit II doesnt have on board UART2 connector
        - If a serial console is needed, a quick workaround may be attaching the Starter Kit to an Explorer 16 Development Board by using a Starter Kit I/O Expansion Board.
        - Another option is to use a telnet connection
        - MHC will throw an error if the UART component is not selected
    - It is preferred that the demos add both telnet and UART2 support. 

* SAM9X60 projects:
    - SAM9x60 projects with FAT FS work with optimization 0 only
        - Reading of the status.xml from the SD card could experience temporary lock ups.
    - The application code uses a Phy reset function
        - This is caused by a bug on the SAM9X60-EK board (KSZ8081 too sensitive to a jittery clock source)
    - The processor selection for debugging should be ARM926EJ-S

* For all the IAR projects:
    - The 'VLA -- variable length arrays' must be allowed in the compiler configuration.
    - Suppress the diagnostics Pe186, Pe188, Pe1029

* SAMA5D2, SAM9X60 IAR projects known issues:
    - The SNMP protocol and corresponding demo applications are not available.
    - IPv6 ULA generation is not available
    - ZCLL module is not supported
    - Crypto library is now supported on the SAMA5D2 processor. However the net_pres layer with wolfSSL encryption has not yet been fully tested for these projects. This will be done in a future release.
    - A workaround for the QSPI plib is in place for this release. When regenerating the code, the workaround must NOT be overwritten.
    - The SAMA5D2 projects need the symbols defined: \_\_SAMA5D2\_\_, \_\_PIC32C\_\_

* The code has been updated to allow the integrating of the WINC driver to the H3 TCP/IP Stack.
    - However the WINC support is not yet available. It will be added in a future release.

* SAM9X60 documentation issues:
    - The documentation for the SAM9X60 EMAC driver is currently missing.
    - The code/RAM resource tables do not contain the SAM9X60 platform.
    - They will be added in a future release.

* When regenerating a project that includes wolfSSL and crypto, MHC will try to include the HAVE_AES_ECB symbol in the configuration.h.
    -  Do not include this symbol as the build will fail. Simply ignore the change.

* The SAME70 XULT board has some issues and detection of the PHY board may fail. This issue is under investigation.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are present in the repo just for reference and not for actual running demos.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are generated using the LAN8740 PHY instead of KSZ8061 which is the default PHY for this board.

* The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. When running demo projects using the V71, the ICD4 flex cable should be removed after programming to run the application.

* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* SDMMC driver may block inside an internal routine while using the HTTP server and locks up the whole application. No workaround exists.
* EDBG programming of a hex file on the SAME54 XPRO board may fail.
* There are some mandatory MISRA violations in some of the repo files. They will be fixed in some next release:
    - System: sys_debug.c, sys_command.c
    - TCP/IP: smtpc.c, ndp.c, custom_http_net_app.c, icmpv6.c,
* Adding TCP/IP components to the project must be done using the TCP/IP Configurators in order to 
  load the dependencies properly. Adding the TCP/IP components from the "Available Components",
  without using configurator, might cause build issues.
* Similarly, remove the TCP/IP components by using the TCP/IP Configurator for the respective layer
* Do not add the TCP/IP components to the project by using both the TCP/IP Configurator and manually adding from "Available Components".
* Do not delete the TCP/IP Configurators from project graph.
* Interactive help using the "Show User Manual Entry" in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided
  by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).
  Please see the "Configuring the Library" section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this module instead.
  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* When the File System service is used in a demonstration application, make sure to set 
  "Maximum Simultaneous File Access" to a number above 10.
  Especially the HTTP server needs to open multiple files simultaneously.
* When the RTOS is enabled, make sure to include RTOS system APIs (like Time Delay functions)
  in application task to give other tasks the chance to execute.
  This can be achieved by enabling the "Use Task Delay" from Application Configuration -> RTOS Configuration.

    - Add any application source files (not generated by MHC) to project by Project->Add Files
    - Select the debugger as CMSIS-DAP
    - Build and debug the project

* For creating an IAR project with MHC for the SAME70/SAMV71 Xplained Ultra platforms the following steps are needed:
    - Run MHC in standalone mode
    - Create new configuration
    - Uncheck checkbox 'convert to relative path for configuration' in MPLAB Harmony Framework Management Tool 
    - Add configuration name as 'sam_e70_xult_iar'
    - Select device as SAME70Q21B
    - Add components in MHC
    - Configure TCP/IP Heap size, configure clock, configure Pins
    - Select the toolchain as IAR, under System module
    - Configure System Heap size.
    - Generate Code
    - Copy flash.icf file from IAR toolchain folder to directory config\<config_name>\
    - Open IAR IDE
    - Create new project
    - Add project connection with .ipcf file in directory config\<config_name>\
    - For SAME70 project, select the device name at Project->Options->General Options as 'Microchip ATSAME70Q21xB'
    - Override default linker script with the flash.icf in config\<config_name>\ folder by Project->Options->Linker->Config->Override Default
    - Update heap and stack size in linker option at Project->Options->Linker->Config

    - Add any application source files (not generated by MHC) to project by Project->Add Files
    - Select the debugger as CMSIS-DAP
    - Build and debug the project.

* For PIC32MX projects on the Ethernet Stater Kit II:
    - PIC32MX device supports only the core timer. If other timer is selected there will be MHC errors during the demo generation.
    - Ethernet Starter Kit II doesnt have on board UART2 connector
        - If a serial console is needed, a quick workaround may be attaching the Starter Kit to an Explorer 16 Development Board by using a Starter Kit I/O Expansion Board.
        - Another option is to use a telnet connection
        - MHC will throw an error if the UART component is not selected
    - It is preferred that the demos add both telnet and UART2 support. 

* For the web_ftp_server_mpfs_fatfs project configurations:
    - A run time exception occurs with the initialization code generated by MHC
    - The workaround in the SYS_Initialize() is to have DRV_MEMORY_Initialize() call (which uses the MPFS file system) earlier than the to DRV_SDSPI_Initialize() call (which uses the FAT FS)
    - Do NOT overwrite the workaround when regenerating the project.
    - This is a known SYS_FS issue which will be solved in a future release.


* SAM9X60 projects:
    - SAM9x60 projects with FAT FS work with optimization 0 only
        - Reading of the status.xml from the SD card could experience temporary lock ups.
    - The application code uses a Phy reset function
        - This is caused by a bug on the SAM9X60-EK board (KSZ8081 too sensitive to a jittery clock source)
    - The processor selection for debugging should be ARM926EJ-S
    - The SST26 component is currently disabled and can not be currently added for SAM9X60 projects
        - The project web_net_server_qspi_mpfs does not support the SAM9X60 configuration

* For all the IAR projects:
    - The 'VLA -- variable length arrays' must be allowed in the compiler configuration.
    - Suppress the diagnostics Pe186, Pe188, Pe1029

* SAMA5D2, SAM9X60 IAR projects known issues:
    - The SNMP protocol and corresponding demo applications are not available.
    - IPv6 ULA generation is not available
    - ZCLL module is not supported
    - Crypto library is now supported on the SAMA5D2 processor. However the net_pres layer with wolfSSL encryption has not yet been fully tested for these projects. This will be done in a future release.
    - A workaround for the QSPI plib is in place for this release. When regenerating the code, the workaround must NOT be overwritten.
    - The SAMA5D2 projects need the symbols defined: \_\_SAMA5D2\_\_, \_\_PIC32C\_\_

* The code has been updated to allow the integrating of the WINC driver to the H3 TCP/IP Stack.
    - However the WINC support is not yet available. It will be added in a future release.

* SAM9X60 documentation issues:
    - The documentation for the SAM9X60 EMAC driver is currently missing.
    - The code/RAM resource tables do not contain the SAM9X60 platform.
    - They will be added in a future release.

Older known issues:

* MHC may hang when configuring NET_PRES Presentation Layer component.
    - Short-term work around is to save MHC state, close and reopen MHC.
* When regenerating a project that includes wolfSSL and crypto, MHC will try to include the HAVE_AES_ECB symbol in the configuration.h.
    -  Do not include this symbol as the build will fail. Simply ignore the change.
* The SAME70 XULT board has some issues and detection of the PHY board may fail. This issue is under investigation.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are present in the repo just for reference and not for actual running demos.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are generated using the LAN8740 PHY instead of KSZ8061 which is the default PHY for this board.
* The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. When running demo projects using the V71, the ICD4 flex cable should be removed after programming to run the application.
* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* The SAME70 and SAMV71 TCPIP demos with SDCARD, wont work with optimisation 0. Use optimization level 1.

* SDMMC driver may block inside an internal routine while using the HTTP server and locks up the whole application. No workaround exists.
* EDBG programming of a hex file on the SAME54 XPRO board may fail.
* There are some mandatory MISRA violations in some of the repo files. They will be fixed in some next release:
    - System: sys_debug.c, sys_command.c
    - TCP/IP: smtpc.c, ndp.c, custom_http_net_app.c, icmpv6.c,
* Adding TCP/IP components to the project must be done using the TCP/IP Configurators in order to 
  load the dependencies properly. Adding the TCP/IP components from the "Available Components",
  without using configurator, might cause build issues.
* Similarly, remove the TCP/IP components by using the TCP/IP Configurator for the respective layer
* Do not add the TCP/IP components to the project by using both the TCP/IP Configurator and manually adding from "Available Components".
* Do not delete the TCP/IP Configurators from project graph.
* Interactive help using the "Show User Manual Entry" in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided
  by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).
  Please see the "Configuring the Library" section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this module instead.
  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* The tcpip_client_server application does not currently have complete documentation. The commands to 
  use this demonstration are provided in the run time help available as console commands.
  This will be added in a future release.
* When the File System service is used in a demonstration application, make sure to set 
  "Maximum Simultaneous File Access" to a number above 10.
  Especially the HTTP server needs to open multiple files simultaneously.
* When the RTOS is enabled, make sure to include RTOS system APIs (like Time Delay functions)
  in application task to give other tasks the chance to execute.
  This can be achieved by enabling the "Use Task Delay" from Application Configuration -> RTOS Configuration.

| [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=ATSAMV71-XULT) |

### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* MHC may hang when configuring NET_PRES Presentation Layer component.
    - Short-term work around is to save MHC state, close and reopen MHC.
* Encryption support has been tested using wolfSSL v3.15.7-stable
    -  Support for newer wolfSSL versions will be added in a future release
* When regenerating a project that includes wolfSSL and crypto, MHC will try to include the HAVE_AES_ECB symbol in the configuration.h.
    -  Do not include this symbol as the build will fail. Simply ignore the change.
* HTTP_NET demos using encryption (wolfSSL) with FreeRTOS are not part of this release 
    - There are some memory overwrite issues when the HTTP_NET + wolfSSL run in multi-threaded mode
    - This is currently under investigation
* The SAME70 XULT board has some issues and detection of the PHY board may fail. This issue is under investigation.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are present in the repo just for reference and not for actual running demos.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are generated using the LAN8740 PHY instead of KSZ8061 which is the default PHY for this board.
* The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. When running demo projects using the V71, the ICD4 flex cable should be removed after programming to run the application.
* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.
* The SAM E70/V71/E54/A5D2 processors do not have a built in factory pre-programmed MAC address.
    - The XULT boards use the AT24MAC402 serial EEPROM for having an unique MAC address per board.
    - Currently the demo applications do not use the AT24MAC402 EEPROM for reading the MAC address. This will be added in a future release.

* The SAME70 and SAMV71 TCPIP demos with SDCARD, wont work with optimisation 0. Use optimization level 1.

* SAMA5D2 projects known issues:
    - The SNMP protocol and corresponding demo applications is not be available.
    - IPv6 ULA generation is not available
    - ZCLL module is not supported
    - Crypto library is now supported on the SAMA5D2 processor. However the net_pres layer with wolfSSL encryption has not yet been fully tested for these projects. This will be done in a future release.
    - A workaround for the QSPI plib is in place for this release. When regenerating the code, the workaround must NOT be overwritten.

* SDMMC driver may block inside an internal routine while using the HTTP server and locks up the whole application. No workaround exists.
* EDBG programming of a hex file on the SAME54 XPRO board may fail.
* There are some mandatory MISRA violations in some of the repo files. They will be fixed in some next release:
    - System: sys_debug.c, sys_command.c
    - TCP/IP: smtpc.c, ndp.c, custom_http_net_app.c, icmpv6.c,
* Adding TCP/IP components to the project must be done using the TCP/IP Configurators in order to 
  load the dependencies properly. Adding the TCP/IP components from the "Available Components",
  without using configurator, might cause build issues.
* Similarly, remove the TCP/IP components by using the TCP/IP Configurator for the respective layer
* Do not add the TCP/IP components to the project by using both the TCP/IP Configurator and manually adding from "Available Components".
* Do not delete the TCP/IP Configurators from project graph.
* Interactive help using the "Show User Manual Entry" in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided
  by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).
  Please see the "Configuring the Library" section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this module instead.
  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* The tcpip_client_server application does not currently have complete documentation. The commands to 
  use this demonstration are provided in the run time help available as console commands.
  This will be added in a future release.
* When the File System service is used in a demonstration application, make sure to set 
  "Maximum Simultaneous File Access" to a number above 10.
  Especially the HTTP server needs to open multiple files simultaneously.
* When the RTOS is enabled, make sure to include RTOS system APIs (like Time Delay functions)
  in application task to give other tasks the chance to execute.
  This can be achieved by enabling the "Use Task Delay" from Application Configuration -> RTOS Configuration.

### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* For projects using the mpfs_img2.c and mpfs_img2_net.c files, these may be absent from the project after regeneration. The MPFS module needs to be removed and re-added to the project.
* The SAME70 XULT board has some issues and detection of the PHY board may fail. This issue is under investigation.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are present in the repo just for reference and not for actual running demos.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are generated using the LAN8740 PHY instead of KSZ8061 which is the default PHY for this board.
* The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. When running demo projects using the V71, the ICD4 flex cable should be removed after programming to run the application.
* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.
* The SAM E70/V71/E54/A5D2 processors do not have a built in factory pre-programmed MAC address.
    - The XULT boards use the AT24MAC402 serial EEPROM for having an unique MAC address per board.
    - Currently the demo applications do not use the AT24MAC402 EEPROM for reading the MAC address. This will be added in a future release.

* The SAME70 and SAMV71 TCPIP demos with SDCARD, wont work with optimisation 0. Use optimization level 1.

* SAMA5D2 projects known issues:
    - The SNMP protocol and corresponding demo applications is not be available.
    - IPv6 ULA generation is not available
    - ZCLL module is not supported
    - Crypto library is now supported on the SAMA5D2 processor. However the net_pres layer has not yet been fully tested for these projects. This will be done in a next release when wolfSSL support is added to the TCP/IP stack.  
    - A workaround for the QSPI plib is in place for this release. When regenerating the code, the workaround must NOT be overwritten.

* SDMMC driver may block inside an internal routine while using the HTTP server and locks up the whole application. No workaround exists.
* The operation over the secure connections using wolfSSL has not been added to the net repo for this release.
    - There are 2 wolfSSL TCP demos in the crypto repo.
    - The web_net_server_nvm_mpfs demo does not currently support encrypted connections.
    - The wolfSSL third party package cannot be added to the application as an encryption provider.
* EDBG programming of a hex file on the SAME54 XPRO board may fail.
* There are some mandatory MISRA violations in some of the repo files. They will be fixed in the next release:
    - System: sys_debug.c, sys_command.c
    - TCP/IP: smtpc.c, ndp.c, custom_http_net_app.c, icmpv6.c,
* Adding TCP/IP components to the project must be done using the TCP/IP Configurators in order to 
  load the dependencies properly. Adding the TCP/IP components from the "Available Components",
  without using configurator, might cause build issues.
* Similarly, remove the TCP/IP components by using the TCP/IP Configurator for the respective layer
* Do not add the TCP/IP components to the project by using both the TCP/IP Configurator and manually adding from "Available Components".
* Do not delete the TCP/IP Configurators from project graph.
* When multiple modules depending on the "netPres" component are added to the project (like Berkeley, HTTP_NET, TELNET etc.),
  multiple 'netPres' nodes will be shown on TCP/IP STACK group box.
  But internally all these TCP/IP modules are using a single instance of the NET_PRES service.
  So only one instance of NET_PRES is needed.
* Interactive help using the "Show User Manual Entry" in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided
  by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).
  Please see the "Configuring the Library" section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this module instead.
  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* The tcpip_client_server application does not currently have complete documentation. The commands to 
  use this demonstration are provided in the run time help available as console commands.
  This will be added in a future release.
* When the File System service is used in a demonstration application, make sure to set 
  "Maximum Simultaneous File Access" to a number above 10.
  Especially the HTTP server needs to open multiple files simultaneously.
* When the RTOS is enabled, make sure to include RTOS system APIs (like Time Delay functions)
  in application task to give other tasks the chance to execute.
  This can be achieved by enabling the "Use Task Delay" from Application Configuration -> RTOS Configuration.

    - For now the SAME70 projects are present in the repo just for reference and not for actual running demos.
    - For now the SAME70 projects are generated using the LAN8740 PHY.
* The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. When running demo projects using the V71, the ICD4 flex cable should be removed after programming to run the application.
* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* The SAME70 and SAMV71 TCPIP demos with SDCARD, wont work with optimisation 0. Use optimization level 1.

    - The SNMP protocol and corresponding demo applications is not be available.
    - IPv6 ULA generation is not available
    - ZCLL module is not supported
    - Crypto library is not supported
    - A workaround for the QSPI plib is in place for this release. When regenerating the code, the workaround must NOT be overwritten.

* SDMMC driver may block inside an internal routine while using the HTTP server and locks up the whole application. No workaround exists.
* The operation over the secure connections using wolfSSL has not been added to the net repo for this release.
    - There are 2 wolfSSL TCP demos in the crypto repo.
* For projects using the mpfs_img2.c and mpfs_img2_net.c files, these may be absent from the project after regeneration. The MPFS module needs to be removed and re-added to the project.
* EDBG programming of a hex file on the SAME54 XPRO board may fail.
* There are some mandatory MISRA violations in some of the repo files. They will be fixed in the next release:
    - System: sys_debug.c, sys_command.c
    - TCP/IP: smtpc.c, ndp.c, custom_http_net_app.c, icmpv6.c,

| Module                | Description                                             |
| ------ | ------ |
| UDP                   | Fixed comments in the UDP header for TCPIP_UDP_OptionSet() not providing 100% compatibility with the BSD setsockopt().    |
| UDP                   | Provided better explanation for some of the UDP_MULTICAST_FLAGS flags.                                                    |
| HTTP_NET              | Added HTTP_NET connection events: open, close, timeout                                                                    |
| HTTP_NET              | Updated the HTTP app with the new SMTPC module changes. Old SMTP module is obsolete now.                                  |
| HTTP_NET              | Added case-insensitive comparison for the HTTP headers. Added stricmp() helper.                                           |
| HTTP_NET              | Added file open/close events.                                                                                             |
| HTTP_NET              | Fixed the legacy mechanism of using callback position. Cleared the callbackPos counter only when the dynamic variable print is called first time. |
| Telnet                | Better processing of the telnet options.                                                                                  |
| Telnet                | Improved the telnet usage of the NET_PRES layer.                                                                          |
| TCPIP Manager         | Updated the processing of the network interface flags to avoid the MAC Initialize flag to remain set if the network interface is stopped before completing initialization.|
| TCPIP Manager         | Fixed the selection of the DNS client as default only if the module is enabled.                                           |
| TCPIP Manager         | Fixed the tcpip_heap_external semaphore delete not checking that it was successfully created.                             |
| mDNS                  | Fixed the use of the wrong field to detect an authoritative reply. The field "qr" was used instead of "aa" when deciding for an authoritative answer.|
| IPv6                  | Fixed the routine converting a string to an IPv6 address.                                                                 |
| TCPIP Commands        | Added missing Close() when MIIM operation failed.                                                                         |

### TESTED WITH:

#### Software Requirements

Before using MPLAB Harmony Net, ensure that the following are installed:
- MPLAB X IDE 5.10 or later
- MPLAB XC32 C/C++ Compiler V2.15 or later
- MPLAB Harmony Configurator 3.1.0
- Harmony net repository, 3.1.0
- Harmony bsp repository, 3.1.0
- Harmony csp repository, 3.10.0
- Harmony core repository, 3.1.0
- Harmony dev_packs repository, 3.1.0
- Harmony mhc repository, 3.1.0
- Harmony mplabx_plugin repository, 3.1.0
- CMSIS-FreeRTOS repository, 10.0.1 for building the FreeRTOS projects (from www.github.com/arm-software/cmsis-freertos)



### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* Adding TCP/IP components to the project must be done using the TCP/IP Configurators in order to 
  load the dependencies properly. Adding the TCP/IP components from the "Available Components",
  without using configurator, might cause build issues.
* Similarly, remove the TCP/IP components by using the TCP/IP Configurator for the respective layer
* Do not add the TCP/IP components to the project by using both the TCP/IP Configurator and manually adding from "Available Components".
* Do not delete the TCP/IP Configurators from project graph.
* When multiple modules depending on the "netPres" component are added to the project (like Berkeley, HTTP_NET, TELNET etc.),
  multiple 'netPres' nodes will be shown on TCP/IP STACK group box.
  But internally all these TCP/IP modules are using a single instance of the NET_PRES service.
  So only one instance of NET_PRES is needed.
* Interactive help using the "Show User Manual Entry" in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided
  by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).
  Please see the "Configuring the Library" section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this module instead.
  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

* The web_net_server_nvm_mpfs demo does not currently support encrypted connections.
  The wolfSSL third party package cannot be added to the application as an encryption provider.
  This will be added in a future release.
* The tcpip_client_server application does not currently have documentation. The commands to 
  use this demonstration are provided in the run time help available as console commands.
  This will be added in a future release.
* When the File System service is used in a demonstration application, make sure to set 
  "Maximum Simultaneous File Access" to a number above 10.
  Especially the HTTP server needs to open multiple files simultaneously.
* When the RTOS is enabled, make sure to include RTOS system APIs (like Time Delay functions)
  in application task to give other tasks the chance to execute.
  This can be achieved by enabling the "Use Task Delay" from Application Configuration -> RTOS Configuration.
