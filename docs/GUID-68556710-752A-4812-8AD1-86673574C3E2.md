**Parent topic:**[Networking Presentation Layer](GUID-75470E5B-2289-4F94-AE85-2BB7DF4C4F07.md)

## C

```
typedef uint16_t (* NET_PRES_EncProviderWriteReady)(void * providerData, uint16_t reqSize, uint16_t minSize); 
```

## Returns

The number of bytes available in the output buffer:

-   \>= reqSize, if the requested space is available in the output buffer

-   \>= minSize, if there's at least this minimum space \(minSize != 0\)

-   0, requested \(minimum\) space cannot be granted


## Description

Presentation Encryption Provider Write Ready Function Pointer Prototype This function pointer defines the write ready function. It is called by the presentation layer when the application wants to check the write space to a secured connection. The function checks for the requested size. If this is not available, it checks for at least minimum size \(if != 0\)

## Preconditions

A connection must have already been created, and be in the open state.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|providerData|A pointer to the buffer for the provider to keep connection specific data.|
|reqSize|The requested size to check for.|
|minSize|Minimum size to check for. Could be 0, if not used.|
