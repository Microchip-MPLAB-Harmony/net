# TCPIP\_HTTP\_FileInclude Function

**Parent topic:**[HTTP Module](GUID-25A4CF50-2F8F-47E7-A90C-ABFA52814459.md)

## C

```
void TCPIP_HTTP_FileInclude(
    HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle, 
    const uint8_t* cFile
);
```

## Description

This function allows an entire file to be included as a dynamic variable, providing a basic templating system for HTML web pages. This reduces unneeded duplication of visual elements such as headers, menus, etc.

When *pHttpCon-\>callbackPos* is 0, the file is opened and as many bytes as possible are written. The current position is then saved to *pHttpCon-\>callbackPos* and the file is closed. On sobsequent calls, reading begins at the saved location and continues. Once the end of the input file is reached, *pHttpCon-\>callbackPos* is set back to 0 to indicate completion.

## Preconditions

None.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|connHandle|HTTP connection handle.|
|cFile|The name of the file to be sent.|

## Returns

None.

## Remarks

Users should not call this function directly,but should instead add dynamic variables in the form of *~inc:filename.ext~* in their HTML code to include the file at that specified location \(for example, "filename.ext"\). The mpfs2.jar utility will handle the rest.
