# TCPIP\_UDP\_SOCKET\_POOL\_BUFFER\_SIZE Macro

**Parent topic:**[UDP Module](GUID-D2D8E9C8-0778-41E2-8F0B-194954B92250.md)

## C

```
#define TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_POOL_BUFFER_SIZE 512 
```

## Description

Size of the buffers in the UDP pool. Any UDP socket that is enabled to use the pool and has the TX size <= than this size can use a buffer from the pool. Note that this setting, together with TCPIP\_UDP\_SOCKET\_POOL\_BUFFERS, has impact on the heap size that's used by the stack \(see TCPIP\_STACK\_DRAM\_SIZE setting\).
