## C

```
TCP_SOCKET TCPIP_TCP_ServerOpen(
    IP_ADDRESS_TYPE addType, 
    TCP_PORT localPort, 
    IP_MULTI_ADDRESS* localAddress
);
```

## Description

Provides a unified method for opening TCP server sockets.

Sockets are created at the TCP module initialization, and can be claimed with this function and freed using TCPIP\_TCP\_Close.

## Preconditions

TCP is initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|addType|The type of address being used. Example: IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV4.|
|localPort|TCP port to listen on for connections.|
|localAddress|Local address to use. Use 0 if listening on any network interface.|

## Returns

-   INVALID\_SOCKET - No sockets of the specified type were available to be opened.

-   TCP\_SOCKET handle - Save this handle and use it when calling all other TCP APIs.


## Remarks

Sockets and user threads protection For efficiency reasons, there is NO PROTECTION for each individual API call except to Open and Close sockets! What it means is that:

-   The user application should close all its sockets before issuing a stack/if down command The stack manager takes care of the internally used sockets

-   A socket can NOT be used concurrently from multiple threads! It's ok to pass a socket from one thread to another as long as there's is no access from more than one thread at a time
