## C

```
#define TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_DEFAULT_RX_QUEUE_LIMIT 3 
```

## Description

The maximum number of RX packets that can be queued by an UDP socket at a certain time. Note that UDP sockets do not use their own RX buffers but instead use the network driver supplied packets and a timely processing is critical to avoid packet memory starvation for the whole stack. This symbol sets the maximum number of UDP buffers/packets that can be queued for a UDP socket at a certain time. Once this limit is reached further incoming packets are silently discarded. Adjust depending on the number of RX buffers that are available for the stack and the amount of memory available to the stack.
