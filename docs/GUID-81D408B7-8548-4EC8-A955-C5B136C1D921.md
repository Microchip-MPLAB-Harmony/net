# TCPIP\_STACK\_NetAddressSet Function

**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_STACK_NetAddressSet(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH, 
    IPV4_ADDR* ipAddress, 
    IPV4_ADDR* mask, 
    bool setDefault
);
```

## Description

This function sets the associated network IP address and/or mask. If you're chaning the network then it is preferred that you set both of these values simultaneously to avoid having the stack running with a mismatch between its IP address and mask.

## Preconditions

The TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) function must have been called before calling this function. The network interface should be up and running.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|netH|Interface handle to set the address of.|
|ipAddress|IP address to set \(could be NULL to set only the mask\).|
|mask|Corresponding network mask to set \(could be NULL to set only the IP address\).|
|setDefault|If true, the interface default address/mask is also set.|

## Returns

-   True - If success.

-   False - If no such interface or interface is not enabled.


## Remarks

Exercise extreme caution when using these functions to change the settings of a running network interface. Chaning these parameters at runtime can lead to unexpected behavior or loss of network connectivity. The preferred way to change the parameters for a running interface is to do so as part of the network configuration passed at the stack initialization.

## Example

```
TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH = TCPIP_STACK_NetHandleGet("PIC32INT");
TCPIP_STACK_NetAddressSet(netH, &myIPAddress, &myIPMask, false);
```
