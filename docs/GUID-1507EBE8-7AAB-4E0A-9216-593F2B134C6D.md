# DRV\_ETHPHY\_VendorDataGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
DRV_ETHPHY_RESULT DRV_ETHPHY_VendorDataGet(DRV_HANDLE handle, uint32_t* pVendorData); 
```

## Returns

DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_OK - if the vendor data is stored at the pVendorData address DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_HANDLE\_ERR - handle error

## Description

This function returns the current value of the vendor data. Each DRV\_ETHPHY client object maintains data that could be used for vendor specific operations. This routine allows retrieving of the vendor specific data.

## Remarks

The PHY driver will clear the vendor specific data before any call to a vendor specific routine. Otherwise the PHY driver functions do not touch this value. The DRV\_ETHPHY\_VendorDataSet can be used for writing data into this field.<br />Currently only a 32 bit value is supported. The function is intended for implementing vendor specific functions, like DRV\_EXTPHY\_MIIConfigure and DRV\_EXTPHY\_MDIXConfigure, that need a way of maintaining their own data and state machine.

## Preconditions

-   The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize routine must have been called.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid device handle.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup must have been called to properly configure the PHY
