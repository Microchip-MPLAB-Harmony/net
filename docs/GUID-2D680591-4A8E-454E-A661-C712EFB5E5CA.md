```

## Description

MIIM client Operation Protection Because of the recirculation of the operation handles and client handles the possibility exists that a misbehaved client inadvertently gets the results of a previous completed operations that now belongs to a different client. When this feature is enabled, extra protection is added for an operation handle to uniquely identify a client that has started the operation and extra check is done that operation belongs to the client that asks for the result.

## Remarks

Set the value to 1 to enable, 0 to disable the feature. Enabling this feature requires a small overhead in code and data size.
