```
bool TCPIP_STACK_NetUp(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH, 
    const TCPIP_NETWORK_CONFIG* pUsrConfig
);
```

## Description

This function brings a network interface up and perform its initialization.

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP stack should have been initialized by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) and the TCPIP\_STACK\_Status\(\) returned SYS\_STATUS\_READY.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|netH|Interface handle.|
|pUsrConfig|Pointer to a TCPIP\_NETWORK\_CONFIG for the interface initialization.|

## Returns

-   True - If success.

-   False - If no such network or an error occurred.


## Remarks

If the interface to be brought up is a primary interface, then all its aliases remain turned down. A separate call to TCPIP\_STACK\_NetUp\(\) is needed for each of the aliases.

If the interface to be brought up is an alias interface, the primary interface of this alias has to be up and running. A separate call to TCPIP\_STACK\_NetUp\(\) is needed for each of the aliases.
