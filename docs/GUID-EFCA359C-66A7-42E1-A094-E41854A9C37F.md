# DRV\_ETHPHY\_Tasks Function

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
void DRV_ETHPHY_Tasks(SYS_MODULE_OBJ object); 
```

## Returns

None

## Description

This function is used to maintain the driver's internal state machine and implement its ISR for interrupt-driven implementations.

## Remarks

-   This function is normally not called directly by an application. It is called by the system's Tasks routine \(SYS\_Tasks\)

-   This function will never block or access any resources that may cause it to block.


## Preconditions

The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified Ethernet PHY driver instance.

## Example

SYS\_MODULE\_OBJ object; // Returned from DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize<br />while \(true\) \{ DRV\_ETHPHY\_Tasks \(object\);<br />// Do other tasks<br />\}
