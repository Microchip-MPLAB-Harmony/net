# DRV\_ETHPHY\_VENDOR\_MDIX\_CONFIGURE Type

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
typedef DRV_ETHPHY_RESULT (* DRV_ETHPHY_VENDOR_MDIX_CONFIGURE)(const struct DRV_ETHPHY_OBJECT_BASE_TYPE* pBaseObj, DRV_HANDLE handle, TCPIP_ETH_OPEN_FLAGS oFlags); 
```

## Returns

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_OK - if success, operation complete

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_PENDING - if function needs to be called again < 0 - on failure: configuration not supported or some other error


## Description

Pointer To Function: typedef DRV\_ETHPHY\_RESULT \(\* DRV\_ETHPHY\_VENDOR\_MDIX\_CONFIGURE\) \( const struct<br />DRV\_ETHPHY\_OBJECT\_BASE\_TYPE\* pBaseObj, DRV\_HANDLE handle, TCPIP\_ETH\_OPEN\_FLAGS oFlags \); This type describes a pointer to a function that configures the MDIX mode for the Ethernet PHY. This configuration function is PHY specific and every PHY driver has to provide their own implementation.

## Remarks

The PHY driver consists of 2 modules:

-   the main/base PHY driver which uses standard IEEE PHY registers

-   the vendor specific functionality This function provides vendor specific functionality. Every PHY driver has to expose this vendor specific function as part of its<br />interface. Traditionally the name used for this function is DRV\_EXTPHY\_MDIXConfigure but any name can be used. The function can use all the vendor specific functions to store/retrieve specific data or start SMI transactions \(see Vendor Interface<br />Routines\). The function should not block but return DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_PENDING if waiting for SMI transactions.


## Preconditions

Communication to the PHY should have been established.
