# DRV\_MIIM\_Close Function

**Parent topic:**[MIIM Driver Library](GUID-A8906C8D-A608-4572-AE74-1E517DD2B0BE.md)

## C

```
void DRV_MIIM_Close(DRV_HANDLE handle); 
```

## Returns

None

## Description

This function closes an opened instance of the MIIM driver, invalidating the handle.

## Remarks

-   After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by calling DRV\_MIIM\_Open before the caller may use the driver again.

-   Usually there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation has completed.


## Preconditions

The DRV\_MIIM\_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified MIIM driver instance. DRV\_MIIM\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Example

DRV\_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV\_MIIM\_Open<br />DRV\_MIIM\_Close\(handle\);
