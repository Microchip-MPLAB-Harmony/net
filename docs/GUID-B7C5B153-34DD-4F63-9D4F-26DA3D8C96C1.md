**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
typedef struct DRV_ETHPHY_OBJECT_BASE_TYPE {
  } DRV_ETHPHY_OBJECT_BASE; 
```

## Description

Ethernet PHY Driver Base Object<br />This data structure identifies the required interface of the Ethernet PHY driver. Any dynamic PHY driver has to export this interface.

## Remarks

The PHY driver consists of 2 modules:

-   the main/base PHY driver which uses standard IEEE PHY registers

-   the vendor specific functionality This object provides the base functionality. Every dynamic PHY driver has to expose this basic functionality as part of its interface. See above the description of each function that's part of the base PHY driver.
