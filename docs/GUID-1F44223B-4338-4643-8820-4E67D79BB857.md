# recvfrom Function

**Parent topic:**[Berkeley Module](GUID-5F35C98C-EC8E-40FF-9B62-3B31D508F820.md)

## C

```
int recvfrom(
    SOCKET s, 
    char* buf, 
    int len, 
    int flags, 
    struct sockaddr* from, 
    int* fromlen
);
```

## Description

The revfrom\(\) function is used to receive incoming data that has been queued for a socket. This function can be used with both datagram and stream type sockets. If the available data is too large to fit in the supplied application buffer *buf*, excess bytes are discarded in case of SOCK\_DGRAM type sockets. For SOCK\_STREAM types, the data is buffered internally so the application can retrieve all data by multiple calls of recvfrom\(\).

## Preconditions

The socket\(\) function should be called.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|s|Socket descriptor returned from previous call to socket\(\).|
|buf|Application data receive buffer.|
|len|Buffer length in bytes.|
|flags|Message flags \(currently this is not supported\).|
|from|Pointer to the sockaddr structure that will be filled in with the destination address.|
|fromlen|Size of buffer pointed by from.|

## Returns

-   If the function is successful, the number of bytes copied to the application buffer *buf* is returned.

-   A return value of SOCKET\_ERROR \(-1\) indicates an error and *errno* is set accordingly.

-   A value of zero indicates socket has been shutdown by the peer.


## Remarks

None.
