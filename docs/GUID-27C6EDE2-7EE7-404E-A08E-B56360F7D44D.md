# TCPIP\_ICMP\_EchoRequestSend Function

**Parent topic:**[ICMP Module](GUID-F3E078F7-6F1D-4D25-A999-F0F3E40A5971.md)

## C

```
ICMP_ECHO_RESULT TCPIP_ICMP_EchoRequestSend(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH, 
    IPV4_ADDR * targetAddr, 
    uint16_t sequenceNumber, 
    uint16_t identifier
);
```

## Description

This function allows a stack client to send an ICMP query message to a remote host. The supplied sequence number and identifier will be used in the query message. The user will be notified by the result of the query using a notification handle registered by using the TCPIP\_ICMP\_CallbackRegister\(\) function.

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP Stack must be initialized and up and running.

## Returns

-   ICMP\_ECHO\_OK - Indicates the query request was successfully sent.

-   ICMP\_ECHO\_RESULT - The query request was unsuccessfully sent, which results in an error code \(interface not ready for transmission, allocation error, etc.\).


## Remarks

This function does not allow the user to specify a data buffer to be sent as part of the request. The preferred function to use is TCPIP\_ICMP\_EchoRequest\(\).

This function will eventually be obsoleted.

## Example

```
IPV4_ADDR remoteAddress = 0xc0a00101;
uint16_t mySequenceNumber = 1;
uint16_t myId = 0x1234;

if(TCPIP_ICMP_EchoRequestSend(0, &remoteAddress, mySequenceNumber, myId) == ICMP_ECHO_OK )
{
    // successfully sent the ICMP request
    //
}
else
{
    // process the error
}
```
