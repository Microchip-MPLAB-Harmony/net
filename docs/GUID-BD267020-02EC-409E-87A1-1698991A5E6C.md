# TCPIP\_BSD\_Socket Function

**Parent topic:**[Berkeley Module](GUID-5F35C98C-EC8E-40FF-9B62-3B31D508F820.md)

## C

```
int TCPIP_BSD_Socket(
    SOCKET s
);
```

## Description

The function returns the native socket number associated with the BSD socket. Using this call the caller can switch to the native TCP/IP API.

## Preconditions

The socket\(\) function should have been called.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|s|Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket\(\).|

## Returns

-   \>= 0 - If function is successful. Value refers to socket number.

-   -1 - No such socket exists and *errno* is set to EBADF.


## Remarks

This function works for both TCP and UDP sockets.

The native UDP sockets are created after a call to bind \(server sockets\) or connect \(client sockets\). The native TCP sockets are created after a call to listen\(\) \(server sockets\) or connect\(\) \(client sockets\). Please note that calling the TCPIP\_BSD\_Socket before one of these calls will return an INVALID\_SOCKET.

The BSD module uses the NET\_PRES layer for supporting encrypted connections. This function returns the transport socket \(TCP/UDP\) associated with the NET\_PRES connection. See TCPIP\_BSD\_PresSocket for getting the NET\_PRES socket.
