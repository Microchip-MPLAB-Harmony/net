# TCPIP\_DHCP\_RequestTimeoutSet Function

**Parent topic:**[DHCP Client Module](GUID-9356D53B-4F42-4E1E-B051-90F7C4D448E6.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_DHCP_RequestTimeoutSet(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNet, 
    uint16_t initTmo, 
    uint16_t dhcpBaseTmo
);
```

## Description

This function allows the run time adjustment of the DHCP time-out values. It specifies for how long the client has to wait for a valid DHCP server reply during the initialization process until acquisition of the host address is considered to have failed. It also sets the DHCP base timeout for DHCP transactions with the server. This is automatically incremented by the DHCP client using an exponential back-off algorithm. Recommended value is 2 <= dhcpBaseTmo <= 64 seconds.

## Preconditions

The DHCP module must be initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hNet|Interface to query.|
|initTmo|Initialization time-out to wait for a valid lease acquisition, in seconds.|
|dhcpBaseTmo|DHCP time-out value for DHCP requests, in seconds.|

## Returns

-   True - If successful.

-   False - If a wrong interface handle or time-out value was provided.


## Remarks

None.
