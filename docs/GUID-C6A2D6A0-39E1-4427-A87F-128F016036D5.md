## C

```
#define TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_POOL_BUFFERS 4 
```

## Description

Number of buffers in the private UDP pool. These are preallocated buffers that are to be used by UDP sockets only. This improves the UDP socket throughput and is meant only for UDP sockets that have to sustain high TX traffic rate. However, this memory is not returned to the stack heap, it always belongs to UDP. A socket needs to have an option set in order to use the buffers pool \(see the UDPSetOptions\(\)\). Use 0 to disable the feature.
