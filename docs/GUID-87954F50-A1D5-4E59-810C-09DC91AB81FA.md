## C

```
#define TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_DEFAULT_TX_SIZE 512 
```

## Description

Default socket TX buffer size. Note that this setting affects all UDP sockets that are created and, together with TCPIP\_UDP\_MAX\_SOCKETS, has a great impact on the heap size that's used by the stack \(see TCPIP\_STACK\_DRAM\_SIZE setting\). When large TX bufferrs are needed, probably a dynamic, per socket approach, is a better choice \(see TCPIP\_UDP\_OptionsSet function\).
