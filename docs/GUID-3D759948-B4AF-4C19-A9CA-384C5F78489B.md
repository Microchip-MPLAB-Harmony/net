## C

```
void DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACDeinitialize(SYS_MODULE_OBJ object); 
```

## Returns

None.

## Description

This function supports teardown of the PIC32 Ethernet MAC \(opposite of set up\). Used by tcpip\_module\_manager.

## Remarks

This function deinitializes the Ethernet controller, the MAC and the associated PHY. It should be called to be release any resources allocated by the initialization and return the MAC and the PHY to the idle/power down state.

## Preconditions

DRV\_ETHMAC\_PIC32MACInitialize must have been called to set up the driver.
