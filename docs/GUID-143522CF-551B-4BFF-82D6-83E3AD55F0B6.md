# DRV\_ETHPHY\_Status

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
SYS_STATUS DRV_ETHPHY_Status(SYS_MODULE_OBJ object); 
```

## Returns

-   SYS\_STATUS\_READY - Indicates that any previous module operation for the specified module has completed

-   SYS\_STATUS\_BUSY - Indicates that a previous module operation for the specified module has not yet completed

-   SYS\_STATUS\_ERROR - Indicates that the specified module is in an error state


## Description

This function provides the current status of the Ethernet PHY driver module.

## Remarks

-   Any value greater than SYS\_STATUS\_READY is also a normal running state in which the driver is ready to accept new operations.

-   SYS\_STATUS\_BUSY - Indicates that the driver is busy with a previous system level operation and cannot start another

-   SYS\_STATUS\_ERROR - Indicates that the driver is in an error state

-   Any value less than SYS\_STATUS\_ERROR is also an error state.

-   SYS\_MODULE\_DEINITIALIZED - Indicates that the driver has been deinitialized

-   The this operation can be used to determine when any of the driver's module level operations has completed.

-   If the status operation returns SYS\_STATUS\_BUSY, the a previous operation has not yet completed. Once the status operation returns SYS\_STATUS\_READY, any previous operations have completed.

-   The value of SYS\_STATUS\_ERROR is negative \(-1\). Any value less than that is also an error state.

-   This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

-   If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be cleared by calling the reinitialize operation. If that fails, the deinitialize operation will need to be called, followed by the initialize operation to return to normal operations.


## Preconditions

The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize function must have been called before calling this function.
