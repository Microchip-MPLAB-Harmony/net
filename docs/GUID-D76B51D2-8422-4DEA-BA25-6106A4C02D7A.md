# TCPIP\_STACK\_InitializeDataGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_STACK_InitializeDataGet(
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ object, 
    TCPIP_STACK_INIT* pStackInit
);
```

## Description

This function returns the data that was used for the last call to the TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\).

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP stack should have been initialized by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) and the TCPIP\_STACK\_Status\(\) returned SYS\_STATUS\_READY.

## Returns

-   True - If the stack is up and running and the stack init data has been copied.

-   False - If the stack is down or an error has occurred.


## Remarks

The stack does not make a persistent copy of the TCPIP\_NETWORK\_CONFIG and TCPIP\_STACK\_MODULE\_CONFIG data that are passed in the TCPIP\_STACK\_INIT at the moment of the stack initialization. It is up to the application to insure that the initialization data is still available after the TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) has been called if this API is used.

## Example

```
TCPIP_STACK_INIT initData;
TCPIP_STACK_InitializeDataGet(tcpipObject, &initData);
```
