## Description

TCP/IP MAC Event.

TCP/IP MAC Events Codes.

This enumeration defines all the possible events that can be reported by the MAC to the stack.

Depending on the type of the hardware Ethernet/Wi-Fi interface, etc., not all events are possible.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_NONE = 0x0000|no event.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_PKTPEND = 0x0001|RX triggered events: A receive packet is pending.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_OVFLOW = 0x0002|RX triggered events: RX FIFO overflow \(system level latency, no descriptors, etc.\).|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_BUFNA = 0x0004|RX triggered events: no RX descriptor available to receive a new packet.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_ACT = 0x0008|RX triggered events: There's RX data available.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_DONE = 0x0010|RX triggered events: A packet was successfully received.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_FWMARK = 0x0020|RX triggered events: the number of received packets is greater than or equal to than the RX Full Watermark.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_EWMARK = 0x0040|RX triggered events: the number of received packets is less than or equal to than the RX Empty Watermark.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_BUSERR = 0x0080|RX triggered events: a bus error encountered during an RX transfer.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_DONE = 0x0100|TX triggered events: A packet was transmitted and its status is available.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_ABORT = 0x0200|TX triggered events: a TX packet was aborted by the MAC \(jumbo/system underrun/excessive defer/late collision/excessive collisions\).|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_BUSERR = 0x0400|TX triggered events: a bus error encountered during a TX transfer.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_CONN\_ESTABLISHED = 0x0800|Connection triggered events: Connection established.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_CONN\_LOST = 0x1000|Connection triggered events: Connection lost.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_ALL = \(TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_PKTPEND\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_OVFLOW\| TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_BUFNA\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_ACT\| TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_DONE\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_FWMARK\| TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_EWMARK\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_RX\_BUSERR\)|Useful Masks: all RX related events.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_ALL = \(TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_DONE\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_ABORT\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_TX\_BUSERR\)|Useful Masks: all TX related events.|

|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_CONN\_ALL = \(TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_CONN\_ESTABLISHED\|TCPIP\_MAC\_EV\_CONN\_LOST\)|Mask of all Connection related events.|

## Remarks

None.
