## Description

TCPIP stack events codes.

This enumeration defines all the possible events that can be reported by the TCPIP stack. These are events received by the stack from the network interfaces. They are reported by the MAC driver of the network interface.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|TCPIP\_EV\_NONE = 0x0000|No event.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_PKTPEND = 0x0001|A receive packet is pending.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_OVFLOW = 0x0002|RX FIFO overflow \(system level latency, no descriptors, etc.\).|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_BUFNA = 0x0004|No RX descriptor available to receive a new packet.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_ACT = 0x0008|There's RX data available.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_DONE = 0x0010|A packet was successfully received.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_FWMARK = 0x0020|The number of received packets is \>= than the RX full watermark.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_EWMARK = 0x0040|The number of received packets is <= than the RX empty watermark.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_BUSERR = 0x0080|A buss error encountered during an RX transfer.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_TX\_DONE = 0x0100|A packet was transmitted and its status is available.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_TX\_ABORT = 0x0200|A TX packet was aborted by the MAC \(jumbo/system under-run/excessive defer/late collision/excessive collisions\).|
|TCPIP\_EV\_TX\_BUSERR = 0x0400|A bus error encountered during a TX transfer.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_CONN\_ESTABLISHED = 0x0800|Connection established.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_CONN\_LOST = 0x1000|Connection lost.|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_ALL = \(TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_PKTPEND|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_OVFLOW|
|TCPIP\_EV\_TX\_ALL = \(TCPIP\_EV\_TX\_DONE|TCPIP\_EV\_TX\_ABORT|
|TCPIP\_EV\_RXTX\_ERRORS = \(TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_OVFLOW|TCPIP\_EV\_RX\_BUFNA|
|TCPIP\_EV\_CONN\_ALL = \(TCPIP\_EV\_CONN\_ESTABLISHED|TCPIP\_EV\_CONN\_LOST\)|

## Remarks

Depending on the type of the hardware interface, no all events are possible. Not that specific interfaces can offer specific events and ufnctions to retrieve those events.
