## Description

IPv4 configuration.

The parameters needed for the IPv4 module initialization.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|arpEntries|The number of entries that IPv4 can queue up for ARP resolution. Usually it should be <= the number of total ARP cache entries for all interfaces.|
|forwardFlags|The maximum number of broadcast and multicast packets that can be queued and waiting for the output interface to transmit them. This applies only for packets that have to be both forwarded and processed internally, which is only broadcast or multicast. Adjust depending on your traffic. Note that if this limit is exceeded, the packets won't be forwarded but still processed internally. If 0, packets won't be forwarded, just processed internally.|
|forwardTableMaxEntries|The maximum number of entries in the forwarding table for each interface.|
|forwardTableSize|The number of entries in the initialization forwarding table. The number of entries per interface cannot exceed the *forwardTableMaxEntries* value.|
|forwardTable|The forwarding table entries to start with. It contains the entries for all interfaces involved in forwarding. The type of the table is given by the flag TCPIP\_IPV4\_FWD\_FLAG\_BINARY\_TABLE/TCPIP\_IPV4\_FWD\_FLAG\_ASCII\_TABLE.|

## Returns

None.

## Remarks

None.
