## C

```
int TCPIP_DNS_GetIPv6Addresses(
    const char* hostName, 
    int startIndex, 
    IPV6_ADDR* pIPv6Addr, 
    int nIPv6Addresses
);
```

## Description

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|

|startIndex|Starting index of the IP address to be returned when multiple addresses are available. The max number of addresses that can be stored for a host name is given by TCPIP\_DNS\_CLIENT\_MODULE\_CONFIG::nIPv6Entries. The current number of valid entries for an address is given by TCPIP\_DNS\_GetIPAddressesNumber\(\). A valid index is \[0, TCPIP\_DNS\_GetIPAddressesNumber\(IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV6\)\).|
|pIPv6Addr|Pointer to array of IPv6 addresses to store the host IPv6 addresses.|
|nIPv6Addresses|Number of IPv6 addresses in the pIPv6Addr array.|

## Returns

-   \> 0 - The number of addresses copied to the pIPv6Addr array.

-   0 - If the host name was not found, invalid index, bad parameter, etc.
