# DRV\_ETHPHY\_VendorSMIReadResultGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
DRV_ETHPHY_RESULT DRV_ETHPHY_VendorSMIReadResultGet(DRV_HANDLE handle, uint16_t* pSmiRes); 
```

## Returns

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_OK - transaction complete and result deposited at pSmiRes.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_PENDING - if the vendor transaction is still ongoing The call needs to be retried. < 0 - some error and the DRV\_EXTPHY\_MIIConfigure/DRV\_EXTPHY\_MDIXConfigure has to return error to be aborted by the<br />DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup


## Description

This function will return the data of a SMI read transfer.

## Remarks

The function is intended for implementing vendor SMI transfers within DRV\_EXTPHY\_MIIConfigure and<br />DRV\_EXTPHY\_MDIXConfigure. It has to be called from within the DRV\_EXTPHY\_MIIConfigure or DRV\_EXTPHY\_MDIXConfigure functions \(which are called, in turn, by the DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup procedure\) otherwise the call will fail.<br />The DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_OK and DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_PENDING significance is changed from the general driver API.

## Preconditions

-   The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize routine must have been called.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid device handle.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup is in progress and configures the PHY

-   The vendor implementation of the DRV\_EXTPHY\_MIIConfigure/DRV\_EXTPHY\_MDIXConfigure is running and a SMI transfer is needed

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_VendorSMIReadStart should have been called to initiate a transfer
