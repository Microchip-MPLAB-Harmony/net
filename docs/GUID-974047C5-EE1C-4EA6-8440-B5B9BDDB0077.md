**Parent topic:**[MIIM Driver Library](GUID-A8906C8D-A608-4572-AE74-1E517DD2B0BE.md)

## C

```
DRV_MIIM_CLIENT_STATUS DRV_MIIM_ClientStatus(DRV_HANDLE handle); 
```

## Returns

-   DRV\_MIIM\_CLIENT\_STATUS\_READY - if the client handle represents a valid MIIM client

-   DRV\_MIIM\_CLIENT\_STATUS\_ERROR - if the client handle is an invalid MIIM client


## Description

This function gets the client-specific status of the MIIM driver associated with the given handle.

## Remarks

This function can be used to check that a client handle points to a valid MIIM client. The MIIM driver queues operations so it will always return DRV\_MIIM\_CLIENT\_STATUS\_READY.

## Preconditions

-   The DRV\_MIIM\_Initialize routine must have been called.

-   DRV\_MIIM\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.
