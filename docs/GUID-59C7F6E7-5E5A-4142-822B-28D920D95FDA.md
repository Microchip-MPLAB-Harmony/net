## Description

HTTP module dynamic configuration data.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|nConnections|Number of simultaneous HTTP connections allowed.|
|dataLen|Size of the data buffer for reading cookie and GET?POST arguments \(bytes\).|
|skTxBuffSize|Size of TX buffer for the associated socket. Leave 0 for default.|
|skRxBuffSize|Size of RX buffer for the associated socket. Leave 0 for default.|
|listenPort|HTTP listening port: 80, 443, etc.|
|nDescriptors|How many buffer descriptors for dynamic variable processing to create. They are independent of the HTTP connection number all the HTTP connections use from the dynamic descriptors pool.|
|nChunks|Maximum number of chunks that are created. It depends on the TCPIP\_HTTP\_NET\_MAX\_RECURSE\_LEVEL and on the number of connections. Maximum number should be TCPIP\_HTTP\_NET\_MAX\_CONNECTIONS \* TCPIP\_HTTP\_NET\_MAX\_RECURSE\_LEVEL. All the chunks are in a pool and are used by all connections.|
|maxRecurseLevel|The maximum depth of recursive calls for serving a web page: - Files without dynvars: 1 - Files including another file: + 1 - File including a dynamic variable: + 1 etc.|
|configFlags|A TCPIP\_HTTP\_NET\_MODULE\_FLAGS value.|
|nFileBuffers|Number of file buffers to be created. These buffers are used to store data while file processing is done. They are organized in a pool. Each file being processed needs a file buffer and tries to get it from the pool. If a buffer is not available, the HTTP conenction will wait for one to become available. Once the file is done the file buffer is released and could be used by a different file. The number depends on the number of files that are processed in parallel. To avoid deadlock, the number should be \>= than the number of maximum files that can be open simultaneously: i.e. for file1 -\>include file2 -\> include file3 you'll need \>= 3 file process buffers.|
|fileBufferSize|Size of each of these file buffers should correspond to TCPIP\_HTTP\_NET\_FILE\_PROCESS\_BUFFER\_SIZE.|
|chunkPoolRetries|How many retries to get chunk from the pool before giving up.|
|fileBufferRetries|How many retries to get a fileBuffer before giving up.|
|dynVarRetries|How many retries to havve for a dynamic variable dynamicPrint\(\) function before calling it done.|
|connTimeout|Persistent connection timeout, in seconds. If non 0 and a persistent connection is idle for more than this timeout, the server will close it. Maximum supported value is 32767 seconds. HTTP specific allocation functions. These functions are used for: - The dynamic variable descriptor - SSI commands - File upload buffer allocation|
|\(\* http\_malloc\_fnc\)\(size\_t bytes\)|Malloc style allocation function for HTTP module.|
|\(\* http\_free\_fnc\)\(void\* ptr\)|Free style allocation function.|
|web\_dir|Web pages directory. The HTTP server will serve pages located under this top directory. No access is possible above this directory. As a good practive to follow, use something like: "/mnt\_point/webpages/" to limit an external user access to this only directory in the file system when using the Web server.|
