# TCPIP\_MAC\_RegisterStatisticsGet Function

**Parent topic:**[MAC Driver Module](GUID-0C1AF471-66D4-472F-84AF-212E9E18B21D.md)

## C

```
TCPIP_MAC_RES TCPIP_MAC_RegisterStatisticsGet(
    DRV_HANDLE hMac, 
    TCPIP_MAC_STATISTICS_REG_ENTRY* pRegEntries, 
    int nEntries, 
    int* pHwEntries
);
```

## Description

This function will get the current value of the statistic registers maintained by the MAC hardware.

## Precondtions

TCPIP\_MAC\_Initialize\(\) should have been called. TCPIP\_MAC\_Open\(\) should have been called to obtain a valid handle.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hMac|Handle identifying the MAC driver client.|
|pRegStatistics|Pointer to a pRegEntries that will receive the current hardware statistics registers values. Can be 0, if only the number of supported hardware registers is requested.|
|nEntries|Provides the number of TCPIP\_MAC\_STATISTICS\_REG\_ENTRY structures present in pRegEntries Can be 0, if only the number of supported hardware registers is requested The register entries structures will be filled by the driver, up to the supported hardware registers.|
|pHwEntries|Pointer to an address to store the number of the statistics registers that the hardware supports It is updated by the driver. Can be 0 if not needed.|

## Returns

-   TCPIP\_MAC\_RES\_OK - If all processing went on OK.

-   TCPIP\_MAC\_RES\_OP\_ERR error code - If function not supported by the driver.


## Remarks

The reported values are info only and change dynamically.
