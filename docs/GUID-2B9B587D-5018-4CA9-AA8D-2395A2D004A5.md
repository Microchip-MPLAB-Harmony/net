# SMTP Module

The SMTP client module in the TCP/IP Stack lets applications send e-mails to any recipient worldwide. These message could include status information or important alerts. Using the e-mail to SMS gateways provided by most cell phone carriers, these messages can also be delivered directly to cell phone handsets

**SMTP Client Short Message Example**

The SMTP client API is simplified when messages can be buffered entirely in RAM. This example sends a brief e-mail message indicating the current status of the board's buttons.

The following diagram provides an overview of the process:

![smtp_diagram](GUID-0558F9A5-6B17-4800-948F-8EB0FD8A49F7-low.png)

-   First, call TCPIP\_SMTP\_UsageBegin to verify that the SMTP client is available and to begin a new message. If FALSE is returned, the SMTP client is busy and the application must return to the main loop to allow StackTask to execute again.

-   Next, set the local relay server to use as TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Server. If the local relay server requires a user name and password, set TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Username and TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Password to the appropriate credentials. If server parameters are not set, the stack will attempt to deliver the message directly to its destination host. This will likely fail due to SPAM prevention measures put in place by most ISPs and network administrators.

-   Continue on to set the header strings as necessary for the message. This includes the subject line, from address, and any recipients you need to add. Finally, set TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Body to the message to be sent.

-   At this point the message is ready to send. Call TCPIP\_SMTP\_MailSend to instruct the SMTP client to begin transmission.

-   The application must now call TCPIP\_SMTP\_IsBusy until it returns FALSE. Each time TRUE is returned, return to the main loop and wait for the system tasks to be executed again. This allows the SMTP server to continue its work in a cooperative multitasking manner. Once FALSE is returned, call TCPIP\_SMTP\_UsageEnd to release the SMTP client. Check the return value of this function to determine if the message was successfully sent.


**SMTP Client Long Message Example**

The SMTP client API is capable of sending messages that do not fit entirely in RAM. To do so, the application must manage its output state and only write as many bytes as are available in the buffer at a time. This example will walk through sending a longer message.

Sending longer messages is divided into three stages. The first stage configures the SMTP client to send the message. The second stage sends the message in small chunks as buffer space is available. The final stage finishes the transmission and determines whether or not the message was successful.

The following diagram illustrates the first stage:

![smtp_diagram2](GUID-A9FB9CE5-411B-47D2-9102-D6203083D456-low.png)

-   The first stage is largely similar to the first few steps in sending a short message. First, call TCPIP\_SMTP\_UsageBegin to verify that the SMTP client is available and to begin a new message. If FALSE is returned, the SMTP client is busy and the application must return to the main loop and wait to execute again.

-   Next, set the local relay server to use as TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Server. If the local relay server requires a user name and password, set TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Username and TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Password to the appropriate credentials. If server parameters are not set, the stack will attempt to deliver the message directly to its destination host. This will likely fail due to SPAM prevention measures put in place by most ISPs and network administrators.

-   Continue on to set the header strings as necessary for the message. This includes the subject line, from address, and any recipients you need to add.

-   The next portion of the process differs. Ensure that TCPIP\_SMTP\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE.Body remains set to its default \(NULL\). At this point, call TCPIP\_SMTP\_MailSend to open a connection to the remote server and transmit the headers. The application is now ready to proceed to the second stage and send the message body.


The following diagram provides an overview of stage two and three:

![smtp_diagram3](GUID-70CDB320-9494-45BC-985D-D81D03CDC559-low.png)

-   Upon entering stage two, the application should call TCPIP\_SMTP\_IsBusy to verify that the connection to the remote server is active and has not been lost. If the call succeeds, call TCPIP\_SMTP\_IsPutReady to determine how many bytes are available in the TX buffer. If no bytes are available, return to the main loop so that StackTask can transmit the data to the remote node and free up the buffer.

-   If space is available, any combination of the TCPIP\_SMTP\_Put, TCPIP\_SMTP\_ArrayPut and TCPIP\_SMTP\_StringPut functions may be called to transmit the message. These functions return the number of bytes successfully written. Use this value, along with the value originally returned from TCPIP\_SMTP\_IsPutReady to track how much free space remains in the TX buffer. Once the buffer is depleted, call TCPIP\_SMTP\_Flush to force the data written to be sent.

-   The SMTP client module can\_accept\_as much data as the TCP TX FIFO can hold. This is determined by the socket TX buffer size.

-   If the TX buffer is exhausted before the message is complete, return to the main loop so that stack may transmit the data to the remote node and free up the buffer. Upon return, go to the beginning of the second stage to transmit the next portion of the message.


Once the message is complete, the application will move to the third stage. Call TCPIP\_SMTP\_PutIsDone to inform the SMTP client that no more data remains. Then call TCPIP\_SMTP\_IsBusy repeatedly. Each time TRUE is returned, return to the main loop and wait for stack to execute again. Once FALSE is returned, the message transmission has completed and the application must call TCPIP\_SMTP\_UsageEnd to release the SMTP client. Check the return value of this function to determine if the message was successfully sent.

**Library Interface**

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|**Macros**||
|TCPIP\_SMTP\_MAX\_WRITE\_SIZE|the max size of data to be written in a discrete string/array email operation: TCPIP\_SMTP\_StringPut/TCPIP\_SMTP\_ArrayPut. Excess characters will be discarded. Note that the higher this value, the greater the size of the underlying TCP socket TX buffer Adjust as needed. Normally should not exceed 512 characters.|
|TCPIP\_SMTP\_SERVER\_REPLY\_TIMEOUT|How long to wait before assuming the connection has been dropped \(default 8 seconds\)|
|TCPIP\_SMTP\_TASK\_TICK\_RATE|SMTP task rate, milliseconds The default value is 55 milliseconds. The lower the rate \(higher the frequency\) the higher the module priority and higher module performance can be obtained The value cannot be lower than the TCPIP\_STACK\_TICK\_RATE.|
|TCPIP\_SMTP\_WRITE\_READY\_SPACE|the minimum amount of data to ask from the transport/encryption layer when querying the write space|
|SMTP\_CONNECT\_ERROR|Connection to SMTP server failed|
|SMTP\_RESOLVE\_ERROR|DNS lookup for SMTP server failed|
|SMTP\_SUCCESS|Message was successfully sent|
