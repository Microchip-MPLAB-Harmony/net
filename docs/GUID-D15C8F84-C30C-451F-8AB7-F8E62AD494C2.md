# DNS Module

The Domain Name Service associates host names \(i.e., www.microchip.com\) with IP addresses \(i.e., 10.0.54.2\). The DNS Client module provides DNS resolution capabilities to the stack. As illustrated in the figure, a typical resolution process is as follows:

-   The DNS Client, also known as the DNS Resolver, will try to resolve the IP address from its local resources, which includes the Name to Address mappings in the local DNS cache. DNS clients are capable of caching the previous DNS query results and this module supports a maximum number of cached entries configured with the DNS\_CLIENT\_CACHE\_ENTRIES parameter. Each cache entry is capable of storing the maximum number of IPv4 and IPv6 address, which is configured using the DNS\_CLIENT\_CACHE\_PER\_IPV4\_ADDRESS and DNS\_CLIENT\_CACHE\_PER\_IPV6\_ADDRESS parameters. The DNS resolver will use these available local resources and if it cannot find the IP Address corresponding to the requested DNS Record type, it will then query a DNS server for the IP Address.

-   The DNS server will directly answer the query if it is the authoritative server for the particular domain \(ex.: www.microchip.com\); otherwise, it will check its local cache of the previous queries. If it cannot find the IP Address, it will then query the DNS servers on the Internet.

-   Next, the DNS Server will query one of the root servers requesting a list of Authoritative servers for the .COM domain. The Root server will respond with the list of servers addresses hosting the .COM domain.

-   The Authoritative DNS server will then respond with the IP Address or a list of IP Address \(if more than one server hosts the website www.microchip.com\) for www.microchip.com.

-   The address that the DNS server returns back to the DNS client is then passed to the DNS application, which initially requested the IP Address information.

-   DNS resolver clients are both internal stack modules \(SNTP, for example\), as well as applications using the TCP/IP stack.

**Abstraction Model**

DNS is part of the Application Layer. Following is a description of how the DNS Client works and how it should be used.

-   By default, the DNS client is enabled and included in the TCP/IP stackbuild.

-   The DNS Client module will use a UDP socket on port number 53 to contact the DNS server.

-   The DNS client can be enabled/disabled dynamically at run time.

-   When the TCP/IP commands module is built in the stack, commands for manipulation of the DNS module are available:

    -   The DNS module can be enabled using the command "dns eth0 on".

    -   The DNS client module can be disabled from the command prompt using "dns eth0 off".

    -   In the above examples the first Ethernet interface is used. Any valid network interface can be used.

-   Applications or demonstrations such as berkeley\_tcp\_client, berkeley\_udp\_client, tcpip\_tcp\_client, and tcpip\_udp\_client, use the TCPIP\_DNS\_Resolve function with Host name and Record type as arguments to resolve the domain host name. The DNS module supports the Record type of "A" for IPv4 addresses and "AAAA" for IPv6.

-   The resolved domain name and the mapped IPv4 or IPv6 address will be stored in a table with the expiration time, which is calculated from the DNS server response.

-   The server supplied IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will be cached internally \(see the DNS\_CLIENT\_CACHE\_PER\_IPV4\_ADDRESS and DNS\_CLIENT\_CACHE\_PER\_IPV6\_ADDRESS parameters\).

-   The TCPIP\_DNS\_IsResolved function will return DNS\_RES\_OK if the domain name resolve is successful.

-   The TCPIP\_DNS\_GetNumberOfIPAddresses function can be used to obtain the number of the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses present in the DNS Resolver tables.

-   The DNS Resolver table \(cache\) stores the dcorresponding name, the IP address and the expiration time returned by the server.

-   The functions, TCPIP\_DNS\_GetIPv4Address and TCPIP\_DNS\_GetIPv6Address, can be used to obtain the IPv4 or Ipv6 addresses for a resolved name entry.
