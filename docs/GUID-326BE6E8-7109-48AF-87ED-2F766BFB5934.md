**Parent topic:**[TCP Module](GUID-9461917B-27CE-44ED-80DB-67D963896E8F.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_TCP_IsReady();
```

## Description

This function returns the current status of the TCP module. If the TCP quiet time has elapsed \(or it was not enabled when TCP was built\) then the TCP module is ready for operation and TCP sockets can send and receive data. If the TCP quiet time is still in effect, then the TCP module is quiet and it won't transmit any kind of data.

## Preconditions

TCP properly initialized.

## Returns

-   True - The quiet time has elapsed and the TCP module is ready to transmit data.

-   False - The quiet time is still in effect and TCP module is silent.


## Remarks

The TCP quiet time occurs at the stack start up and can be enabled/disabled using the TCP module configuration parameters.
