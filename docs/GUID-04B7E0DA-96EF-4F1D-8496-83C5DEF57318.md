# DRV\_ETHPHY\_RESET\_FUNCTION Type

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
typedef void (* DRV_ETHPHY_RESET_FUNCTION)(const struct DRV_ETHPHY_OBJECT_BASE_TYPE* pBaseObj); 
```

## Returns

None

## Description

Pointer to Function: typedef void \(\* DRV\_ETHPHY\_RESET\_FUNCTION\) \( const struct DRV\_ETHPHY\_OBJECT\_BASE\_TYPE\*<br />pBaseObj\); This type describes a pointer to a function that is called by the driver before starting the detection and initialization process to the PHY - as a result of the DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup call.

## Remarks

The PHY driver will call this function as part of its detection and initialization procedure. It can be used for implementing extra steps that the user needs, before the driver starts talking to the PHY. For example, if a hard reset needs to be applied to the PHY. The function should be short and not block. It is meant just for short I/O operations, not for lengthy processing.

## Preconditions

None
