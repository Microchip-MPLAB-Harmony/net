## Description

Enumeration: TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_TYPE.

Description of the signals/events that a TCP socket can generate.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_TX\_DONE = 0x0001|A TCP packet was successfully transmitted on the interface. This may indicate or not that new data can be sent with this socket. Note 1: The TCP buffer space is controlled by the TCP state machine; The fact that a packet was transmitted, doesn't necessarily mean that new data can be written into the socket buffer: 2: The packet may be an ACK only packet, retry packet, etc., and does not free any writing space in the socket buffer 3: A new socket writing space may not be available because the other party has not acknowledged the data it was sent so far. Therefore, the information carried by this signal has limited usage. 4: This notification is the result of an user action \(explicit call to TCPIP\_TCP\_Flush\) or as a result of the internal TCP state machine.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_TX\_DATA\_DONE = 0x0002|A TCP data packet carrying valid payload was successfully transmitted on the interface. This may indicate or not that new data can be sent with this socket.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_TX\_SPACE = 0x0004|New TX space is available in the socket TX buffer. This event signals that the remote party has acknowledged some data and, as a result, TX buffer space is available.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_TX\_RST = 0x0008|Reset sent to the remote host and connection is reset.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_ESTABLISHED = 0x0100|Socket established a connection \(client or server socket\).|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_RX\_DATA = 0x0200|A data packet was successfully received and there is data available for this socket.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_RX\_FIN = 0x0400|Remote host finished its data and sent a FIN.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_RX\_RST = 0x0800|Remote host reset the connection.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_KEEP\_ALIVE\_TMO = 0x1000|Keep alive has timed out; Connection to the remote host has been aborted.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_IF\_DOWN = 0x2000|Associated interface is going down; sockets connected on this interface will be disconnected, but still alive.|
|TCPIP\_TCP\_SIGNAL\_IF\_CHANGE = 0x4000|Associated interface has changed address sockets connected on this interface will be disconnected, but still alive.|

## Remarks

These signals are used in the socket event handling notification functions. It is possible that multiple flags are set as part of the same notification.

The signals are 16 bits wide.
