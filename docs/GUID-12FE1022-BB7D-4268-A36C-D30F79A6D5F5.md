# IPV6\_EVENT\_HANDLER Type

**Parent topic:**[IPv6 Module](GUID-F2484EF9-7914-43EE-A5B7-4FFDC27C8135.md)

## C

```
typedef void (* IPV6_EVENT_HANDLER)(TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNet, IPV6_EVENT_TYPE evType, const void* evParam, const void* usrParam);
```

## Desscription

Type: IPV6\_EVENT\_HANDLER.

Once an IPv6 event occurs, the IPv6 service will call the registered handler. The handler has to be short and fast. It is meant for setting an event flag, not for lengthy processing.

*evParam* is a parameter that's associated to an IPv6 event.

-   For an address event \(IPV6\_EVENT\_ADDRESS\_ADDED, IPV6\_EVENT\_ADDRESS\_REMOVED\) it should typecast to \(const IPV6\_ADDR\_STRUCT\*\)

-   For an IPV6\_EVENT\_ULA\_ADDRESS\_GENERATED ULA event it should typecast to \(const IPV6\_ADDR\*\)

-   For an IPV6\_EVENT\_ULA\_ADDRESS\_FAILED ULA event the evParam is an IPV6\_ULA\_RESULT error code


The *evParam* is invalid outside of the IPV6\_EVENT\_HANDLER context call and should not be stored by the caller. Info that's needed has to be copied into caller's own context.

*usrParam* is a user-supplied parameter.

## Remarks

For address related events, the passed \(const IPV6\_ADDR\_STRUCT\*\) parameter is invalid after the notification call.
