# TCPIP\_STACK\_EventsPendingGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
TCPIP_EVENT TCPIP_STACK_EventsPendingGet(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNet
);
```

## Description

This function returns the currently pending events. Multiple events can be ORed together as they accumulate.

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP stack should have been initialized by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) and the TCPIP\_STACK\_Status\(\) returned SYS\_STATUS\_READY. The network interface should be up and running.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hNet|Network handle.|

## Returns

-   The currently TCP/IP pending events.


## Remarks

This is the preferred method to get the current pending stack events. Even with a notification handler in place, it's better to use this function to get the current pending events. The returned value is just a momentary value. The pending events can change any time. If the *hNet* refers to an alias interface, the events of the primary interface are returned.

## Example

```
TCPIP_EVENT currEvents = TCPIP_STACK_EventsPendingGet( hNet);
```
