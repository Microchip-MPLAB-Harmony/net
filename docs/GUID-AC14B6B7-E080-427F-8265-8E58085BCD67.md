# TCPIP\_STACK\_Task Function

**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
void TCPIP_STACK_Task(
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ object
);
```

## Description

TCP/IP stack execution state machine. Stack Finite-State Machine \(FSM\) is executed.

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP stack should have been initialized by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\).

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|object|Object handle returned by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\).|

## Returns

None.

## Remarks

This FSM checks for new incoming packets, and routes it to appropriate stack components. It also performs timed operations.

This function must be called periodically to ensure timely responses.

This function continues the stack initialization process after the TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) was called. The TCPIP\_STACK\_Status\(\) will report SYS\_STATUS\_BUSY while the initialization is in progress.
