    uint8_t* buffer, 
    uint16_t count
);

## Description

This function reads an array of data bytes from a TCP socket's RX buffer/FIFO. The data is removed from the FIFO in the process.

## Preconditions

TCP is initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hTCP|The socket from which data is to be read.|
|buffer|Pointer to the array to store data that was read.|
