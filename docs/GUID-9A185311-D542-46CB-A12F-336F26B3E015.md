## Description

Structure: TCPIP\_SMTPC\_MAIL\_MESSAGE.

This data structure describes a mail message.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|from|Mandatory Mail Fields|
|recipient return address.|Â |
|to|Destination address.|
|sender|Optional Mail Fields, if sent on behalf of someone else.|
|cc|Carbon copy destination address.|
|bcc|Blind carbon copy destination address.|
|date|Date for the mail message Should be formatted like: "Wed, 20 July 2016 14:55:06 -0600". If NULL, then the TCPIP\_SMTPC\_CLIENT\_MESSAGE\_DATE will be used.|
|subject|Regular Mail Fields mail subject line.|
|nBuffers|Mail Attachments number of attached buffers|
|attachBuffers|Array of buffer attachments.|
|nFiles|Number of attached files.|
|attachFiles|Array of file attachments.|
|username|Mail Authentication: username to be presented when the mail server requires authentication.|
|password|Associated password to be presented when the mail server requires authentication.|
|smtpServer|Mail Server: address or name of a server to send the mail to \(smtp.gmail.com, 74.125.23.109, etc.\).|
|serverPort|Port on which the SMTP server listens on. Standard SMTP ports are 25 or 587 For servers supporting TLS \(gmail, yahoo, etc.\), the recommended port is 587.|
|messageFlags|Additional message flags.|
|messageCallback|Mail Notifications: message completion notification could be NULL if not needed.|
|replyCallback|Server reply notification could be NULL if not needed.|

## Remarks

SMTPC does NOT make private copies of the strings, buffers, etc. presented in a TCPIP\_SMTPC\_MAIL\_MESSAGE data structure. All fields that are pointers to strings, buffers, files names, etc. MUST be persistent until the mail complete notification is received.

The TCPIP\_SMTPC\_MAIL\_MESSAGE data structure itself does not need to be persistent.

The mail body is not a char\* but uint8\_t\* to allow sending binary data as well as part of the mail body. This requires though that the bodySize member is present.

If some file could not be opened when the mail is sent a warning will be issued and the file will be ignored.

Currently the fields: "sender", "cc" and "bcc" are not used. They will be eventually added.
