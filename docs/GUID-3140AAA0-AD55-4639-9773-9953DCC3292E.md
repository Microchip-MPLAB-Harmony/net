## Description

Structure: TCPIP\_SMTPC\_MODULE\_CONFIG.

This data structure describes the SMTPC configuration data. It is presented to the module as part of the module initialization.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|nMailConnections|Number of mail connections to be created each mail message to be sent requires a mail connection adjust based on the number of simultaneous mail messages in transit.|
|serverReplyTmo|General server response timeout, in seconds. Should be adjusted according to the server responsivity RFC specifies it as 5 min.|
|serverDataTmo|Server response timeout to acknowledge a received mail body/data, in seconds. Should be adjusted according to the server responsivity RFC specifies it as 10 min.|
|tlsHandshakeTmo|Secure connection establishment timeout, in seconds, usually few seconds.|
|nMailRetries|How many times to retry sending a failed mail message. Retries occur only for server reported transient errors. Could be 0 if only one mail send is to be attempted, without retries.|
|serverRetryTmo|The retry interval because of a server transient error, in seconds. RFC specifies it should be at least 30 min.|
|smtpcRetryTmo|The retry interval because of a SMTPC temporary error, in seconds. These include temporary errors related to: DNS, socket connection, TLS.|
|sktTxBuffSize|Size of TX buffer for the associated socket; leave 0 for default.|
|sktRxBuffSize|Size of RX buffer for the associated socket; leave 0 for default.|

## Remarks

None.
