## Description

Structure: IPV6\_PACKET.

IPv6 packets are queued for future transmission.*queuedPacketTimeout* is used to time-out IPv6 queued packets.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|next|Next packet in a queue.|
|payloadLen|Amount of data in payload buffer.|
|headerLen|Total header length \(IP header + IPv6 extension headers\).|
|upperLayerHeaderLen|Total length of the upper layer header.|
|upperLayerChecksumOffset|Offset of the upper layer checksum.|
|upperLayerHeaderType|Type definition for the upper-layer header type.|
|useUnspecAddr: 1;|This packet should use the unspecified address.|
|sourceSpecified: 1;|The upper layer or application layer specified a source address.|
|queued : 1;|Packet has been queued.|
|addressType : 2;|IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV6 or IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV4.|
|remoteMACAddr|The packet's remote MAC address.|
|ackFnc|Function to be called when IPv6 is done with the packet.|
|macAckFnc|Function to be called when MAC is done with a TX packet.|
|ackParam|Parameter to be used.|
|clientData|Optional packet client data.|
|neighbor|The neighbor that the message was received from.|
|offsetInSegment|Offset used for storing fragment transmission information.|
|queuedPacketTimeout|Time out for IPv6 packets which are queued.|
|netIfH|Packet network interface.|
|ipv6Header|IPv6 header definition.|
|payload|IPv6 data segment payload.|

## Remarks

For IPv6 queuing the time out has to be 0. The queue is processed separately by the NDP.IPV6\_PACKET\_ACK\_FNC\(\) is called after the successful removal and inclusion of the packet.
