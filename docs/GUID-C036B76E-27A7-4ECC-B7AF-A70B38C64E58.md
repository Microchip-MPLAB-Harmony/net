# DRV\_ETHPHY\_LinkStatusGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
DRV_ETHPHY_RESULT DRV_ETHPHY_LinkStatusGet(DRV_HANDLE handle, DRV_ETHPHY_INTERFACE_INDEX portIndex, DRV_ETHPHY_LINK_STATUS* pLinkStat, bool refresh); 
```

## Returns

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_PENDING for ongoing, in progress operation

-   an DRV\_ETHPHY\_RESULT error code if the link status get procedure failed.


## Description

This function returns the current link status.

## Remarks

This function reads the Ethernet PHY to get current link status. If refresh is specified then, if the link is down a second read will be performed to return the current link status.<br />Use DRV\_ETHPHY\_ClientStatus\(\) and DRV\_ETHPHY\_ClientOperationResult\(\) to check when the operation was completed and its outcome.

## Preconditions

-   The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize routine must have been called.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid device handle.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup must have been called to properly configure the PHY
