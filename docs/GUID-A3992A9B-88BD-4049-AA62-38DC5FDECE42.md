## Description

MAC Packet.

Structure of a packet transferred with the MAC. This is the structure used for both TX and RX. See the description of each individual field.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|next|Multi-packet/queuing support. This field is used for chaining/queuing packets.|
|pkt\_next|Multi-packet/queuing support. This field is used for chaining packet fragments, etc.|
|ackFunc|Packet acknowledgment function. On TX: A stack module owns the packet. Once the MAC is done transmitting the packet \(success or failure\) it has to set an appropriate acknowledge result in the ackRes field \( a TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_RES\) adjust some packet flags \(see TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_QUEUED\) and call the packet acknowledge function \(ackFunc\). This call informs the packet owner that the MAC is done with using that packet. It is up to the implementation what action the ackFunc takes: reuse, free, discard the packet or if some of the above steps are included in the ackFunc itself. On RX: The packet is under the MAC control and it's passed to the stack when it contains valid data. Once the recipient of the packet \(IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, etc.\) is done with the packet processing it has to set an appropriate acknowledge result in the ackRes field \( a TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_RES\) adjust some packet flags \(see TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_QUEUED\) and call the packet acknowledge function \(ackFunc\). This call informs the packet owner \(the MAC\) that the processing of the packet is completed. It is up to the implementation what action the ackFunc takes: reuse, free, discard the packet or if some of the above steps are included in the ackFunc itself.|
|ackParam|Associated acknowledgment parameter to be used when ackFunc is called. For TX packets: this is a client supplied parameter and is not used by the MAC driver. For RX: If the MAC owns the RX packet then the MAC driver can use this field for further dispatching in the MAC driver owned acknowledgment function.|
|pDSeg|Data \(root\) segment associated to this packet. It is up to the design if the root data segment associated with a packet is contiguous in memory with the packet itself. It can be 0 if the packet has no associated data.|
|pMacLayer|Pointer to the MAC frame. On TX: the sending higher layer protocol updates this field. On RX: the MAC driver updates this field before handing over the packet. \(MCHP TCP/IP stack note: The packet allocation function update this field automatically\).|
|pNetLayer|Pointer to the network layer data. On TX: the sending higher layer protocol updates this field. The MAC driver shouldn't need this field. On RX: the MAC driver updates this field before handing over the packet. \(MCHP TCP/IP stack note: The packet allocation function updates this field automatically. But not for IPv6!\).|
|pTransportLayer|Pointer to the transport layer. The MAC driver does not use this field.|
|totTransportLen|Total length of the transport layer. The MAC driver shouldn't need this field.|
|pktFlags|TCPIP\_MAC\_PACKET\_FLAGS associated packet flags. On TX: the MAC driver has to set: TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_QUEUED - if the driver needs to queue the packet On RX: the MAC driver updates this field before handing over the packet. Flags that the MAC driver has to set/clear: TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_RX and TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_UNICAST, TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_BCAST and TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_MCAST TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_QUEUED TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_SPLIT|
|tStamp|Time stamp value. Statistics, info. On TX: the sending higher layer protocol updates this field. The MAC driver shouldn't need this field On RX: the MAC driver updates this field before handing over the packet.|
|pktIf|The packet interface. On TX: the sending higher layer protocol updates this field. The MAC driver doesn't use this field. On RX: the receiving higher level protocol updates this value. The MAC driver doesn't use this field.|
|ackRes|A TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_RES code associated with the packet. On TX: The MAC driver sets this field when calling the packet ackFunc. On RX: The higher level protocol which is the recipient of the packet sets this field when calling the packet ackFunc.|
|pktPriority|Priority associated with the packet. On TX: The MAC driver use this field to transmit packet using priority queues. On RX: The MAC driver inform stack about the priority of the packet received.|
|pktClientLoad|Additional client packet payload, variable packet data. Ignored by the MAC driver.|

## Remarks

Specific TCP/IP stack implementations might offer packet support functions to assist in driver development. \(For the MCHP TCP/IP stack see tcpip\_packet.h\).

Since the packets may be dynamically allocated, an acknowledge function can result in data deallocation \(blocking\). Therefore, the acknowledgment function should NOT be called from within an interrupt context.
