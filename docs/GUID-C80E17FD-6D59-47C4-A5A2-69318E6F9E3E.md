# TCPIP\_UDP\_ArrayPut Function

**Parent topic:**[UDP Module](GUID-D2D8E9C8-0778-41E2-8F0B-194954B92250.md)

## C

```
uint16_t TCPIP_UDP_ArrayPut(UDP_SOCKET hUDP, const uint8_t * cData, uint16_t wDataLen); 
```

## Returns

The number of bytes successfully placed in the UDP transmit buffer. If this value is less than wDataLen, then the buffer became full and the input was truncated.

## Description

This function writes an array of bytes to the UDP socket, while incrementing the socket write pointer. TCPIP\_UDP\_PutIsReady should be used before calling this function to verify that there is room in the socket buffer.

## Remarks

The return value could be 0 if there is no TX buffer available \(for example the socket has TX data queued and the TCPIP\_UDP\_PutIsReady has not been called or the TX buffer allocation failed\). The return value could be < than wDataLen depending on the size and the available space of the socket TX buffer

## Preconditions

UDP socket should have been opened with TCPIP\_UDP\_ServerOpen/TCPIP\_UDP\_ClientOpen. hUDP - valid socket cData - valid pointer

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hUDP|UDP socket handle|
|cData|The array to write to the socket.|
|wDataLen|Number of bytes from cData to be written.|
