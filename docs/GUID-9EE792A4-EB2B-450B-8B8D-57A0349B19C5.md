## C

```

## Description

DHCPv6 reported event structure:

Type: TCPIP\_DHCPV6\_EVENT\_HANDLER.

Prototype of a DHCP event handler. Clients can register a handler with the DHCP service. Once an DHCP event occurs the DHCP service will called the registered handler. The handler has to be short and fast. It is meant for setting an event flag, not for lengthy processing.

if *pDhcpIaEvent* == 0, no info is carried for a specific IA if *pDhcpIaEvent* != 0, the info carried by this pointer is not persistent and is valid only within the context of this event handler.
