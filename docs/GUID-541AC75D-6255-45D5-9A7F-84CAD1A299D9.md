**Parent topic:**[Ethernet MAC Driver Library](GUID-A4DC3D07-DDAD-4748-A855-304CA3439336.md)

## C

```
bool DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACPowerMode(DRV_HANDLE hMac, TCPIP_MAC_POWER_MODE pwrMode); 
```

## Returns

-   true if the call succeeded.

-   false if the call failed


## Description

This function sets the power mode for the Ethernet MAC.

## Remarks

This function is not currently supported by the Ethernet MAC and will always return true.

## Preconditions

DRV\_ETHMAC\_PIC32MACInitialize must have been called to set up the driver. DRV\_ETHMAC\_PIC32MACOpen\(\) should have been called to obtain a valid handle.

## Example Function

bool DRV\_ETHMAC\_PIC32MACPowerMode\( DRV\_HANDLE hMac, TCPIP\_MAC\_POWER\_MODE pwrMode \)
