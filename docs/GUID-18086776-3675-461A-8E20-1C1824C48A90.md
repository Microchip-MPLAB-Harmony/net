# TCPIP\_TCP\_Bind Function

**Parent topic:**[TCP Module](GUID-9461917B-27CE-44ED-80DB-67D963896E8F.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_TCP_Bind(
    TCP_SOCKET hTCP, 
    IP_ADDRESS_TYPE addType, 
    TCP_PORT localPort, 
    IP_MULTI_ADDRESS* localAddress
);
```

## Description

This function is meant for unconnected server and client sockets. It is similar to TCPIP\_TCP\_SocketNetSet that assigns a specific source interface for a socket. If localPort is 0 the stack will assign a unique local port. Sockets don't need specific binding, it is done automatically by the stack. However, specific binding can be requested using these functions. Works for both client and server sockets.

## Preconditions

TCP socket should have been opened with TCPIP\_TCP\_ServerOpen\(\)/TCPIP\_TCP\_ClientOpen\(\). hTCP - valid socket.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hTCP|Socket to bind.|
|addType|The type of address being used. Example: IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV4/IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV6.|
|localPort|local port to use. If 0, the stack will assign a unitue local port.|
|localAddress|The local address to bind to. Could be NULL if the local address does not need to be changed.|

## Returns

-   True - Indicates success.

-   False - Indicates failure.


## Remarks

The call will fail if the socket is already connected \(both server and client sockets\).
