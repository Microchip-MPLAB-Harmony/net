## C

```
SOCKET accept(
    SOCKET s, 
    struct sockaddr* addr, 
    int* addrlen
);
```

## Description

The accept function is used to accept connection request queued for a listening socket. If a connection request is pending, accept removes the request from the queue, and a new socket is created for the connection. The original listening socket remains open and continues to queue new connection requests. The socket must be a SOCK\_STREAM type socket.

## Preconditions

The listen function should be called.

## Parameters

\|Parameters \|Description \|<br />\|s \|Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket. Must be bound to a local name and in listening mode. \|<br />\|addr \|Optional pointer to a buffer that reveives the address of the connecting entity. \|<br />\|addrlen \|Optional pointer to an integer that contains the length of the address addr. \|

## Returns

-   non-negative integer - The function succeeds and the integer is a descriptor for the accepted socket.

-   SOCKET\_ERROR - Function failed. *errno* is set accordingly.


## Remarks

None.
