# TCPIP\_STACK\_NetMACRegisterStatisticsGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_STACK_NetMACRegisterStatisticsGet(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH, 
    TCPIP_MAC_STATISTICS_REG_ENTRY* pRegEntries, 
    int nEntries, 
    int* pHwEntries
);
```

## Description

This function returns the hardware statistics register data of the MAC that is attached to the specified network interface.

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP stack should have been initialized by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) and the TCPIP\_STACK\_Status\(\) returned SYS\_STATUS\_READY. The network interface should be up and running.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|netH|Handle of the interface to use.|
|pRegStatistics|Pointer to a *pRegEntries* that will receive the current hardware statistics registers values. Can be 0, if only the number of supported hardware registers is requested.|
|nEntries|Provides the number of TCPIP\_MAC\_STATISTICS\_REG\)ENTRY structures present in *pRegEntries*. Can be 0, if only the number of supported hardware registers is requested. The register entries structures will be filled by the driver, up to the supported hardware registers.|
|pHwEntries|Pointer to an address to store the number of the statistics registers that the hardware supports. It is updated by the driver. Can be 0 if not needed.|

## Returns

-   True - If the call succeeded.

-   False - If the call failed \(the corresponding MAC does not implement hardware statistics counters\).


## Remarks

If the *netH* refers to an alias interface, the MAC register statistics of the primary interface are returned.

## Example

```
TCPIP_MAC_REG_STATISTICS regStatistics;
TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH = TCPIP_STACK_NetHandleGet("PIC32INT");
if(TCPIP_STACK_NetMACRegisterStatisticsGet(netH, &regStatistics))
{
    // display the hardware statistics registers for the internal PIC32 MAC attached to this interface
}
```
