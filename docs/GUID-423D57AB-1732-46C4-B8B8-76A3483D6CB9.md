# TCPIP\_UDP\_SOCKET\_DEFAULT\_TX\_QUEUE\_LIMIT Macro

## C

```
#define TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_DEFAULT_TX_QUEUE_LIMIT 3 
```

## Description

The maximum number of TX packets that can be queued by an UDP socket at a certain time. For sockets that need to transfer a lot of data \(Iperf, for example\), especially on slow connections this limit prevents running out of memory because the MAC/PHY transfer cannot keep up with the UDP packet allocation rate imposed by the application. Adjust depending on the TCPIP\_UDP\_SOCKET\_DEFAULT\_TX\_SIZE, the connection speed and the amount of memory available to the stack.
