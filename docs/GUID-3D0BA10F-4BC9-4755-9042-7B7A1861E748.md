# TCPIP\_DNS\_Send\_Query Function

**Parent topic:**[DNS Module](GUID-D15C8F84-C30C-451F-8AB7-F8E62AD494C2.md)

## C

```
TCPIP_DNS_RESULT TCPIP_DNS_Send_Query(
    const char* hostName, 
    TCPIP_DNS_RESOLVE_TYPE type
);
```

## Description

This function attempts to send a query packet for the supplied host name and DNS type.

## Preconditions

The DNS client module must be initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hostName|A pointer to the null terminated string specifying the host for which to resolve an IP.|
|type|A TCPIP\_DNS\_RESOLVE\_TYPE value specifying the desired resolution.|

## Returns

-   TCPIP\_DNS\_RES\_OK - Success, name is solved.

-   TCPIP\_DNS\_RES\_PENDING - Operation is ongoing.

-   TCPIP\_DNS\_RES\_NAME\_IS\_IPADDRESS - Name request is a IPv4 or IPv6 address.

-   An error code if an error occurred.


## Remarks

If the name is already part of the DNS resolution process \(has been previously requested with TCPIP\_DNS\_Resolve or TCPIP\_DNS\_Send\_Query\) the function will force a new DNS query . If the name resolution is already solved and completed, this function will mark it as incomplete and a new response from the server will be requested.

If the name was not part of the DNS client resolution, then this function is equivalent to TCPIP\_DNS\_Resolve\(\).
