## C

```
TCPIP_IGMP_RESULT TCPIP_IGMP_Subscribe(
    UDP_SOCKET socket, 
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNet, 
    IPV4_ADDR mcastAddress, 
    TCPIP_IGMP_FILTER_TYPE filterMode,

);
```

## Description

This function performs the subscription of a UDP socket to multicast traffic. Following this call, the IGMP module will inform network routers of this host desire to take part in multicast traffic.

## Preconditions

The IGMP module must be initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|socket|The UDP multicast socket.|
|hNet|Interface handle. if *hNet == 0*, then the default interface will be used.|
|mcastAddress|The multicast address to subscribe to. It has to be within the IANA specified multicast address range.|
|filterMode|File type required for this subscription: include/exclude.|
|sourceList|Array of destination sources for which the socket is supposed to listen \(filer is include\) or is not interested in \(filter is exclude\).|
|listSize|The number of sources in the sourceList array. On input, if *listSize == 0* or *\*listSize == 0*, then no sources will be considered and sourceList will be ignored. On output, if *listSize != 0*, it will contain the number of new sources added/removed.|

## Returns

-   TCPIP\_IGMP\_OK - if operation succeeded. An error code otherwise.


## Remarks

The function supports both SSM \(Source Specific Multicast\) and ASM \(Any Source Multicast\) functionality.

Subscribe\(skt, INCLUDE, \{a,b\}\) and then Subscribe\(skt, INCLUDE, \{c, d\}\) is legal and will just add new sources to include. Subscribe\(skt, EXCLUDE, \{a, b\}\) and then Subscribe\(skt, EXCLUDE, \{c, d\}\) is also legal and will just exclude new sources.

However, Subscribe\(skt, INCLUDE, \{a, b\}\) and then Subscribe\(sky, EXCLUDE, \{c, d\}\) will change the socket filter mode and old sources will be removed. Same for Subscribe\(skt, EXCLUDE, \{a,b\}\) and then Subscribe\(skt, INCLUDE, \{c, d\}\).

Subscribe\(skt, INCLUDE, \{\}\) will remove all subscriptions for the socket .

For SSM sources, the EXCLUDE mode is not allowed.
