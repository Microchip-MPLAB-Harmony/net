# DRV\_ETHPHY\_Open Function

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
DRV_HANDLE DRV_ETHPHY_Open(const SYS_MODULE_INDEX drvIndex, const DRV_IO_INTENT intent); 
```

## Returns

-   valid open-instance handle if successful \(a number identifying both the caller and the module instance\).

-   DRV\_HANDLE\_INVALID if an error occurs


## Description

This function opens the specified Ethernet PHY driver instance and provides a handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to identify the caller and the instance of the driver.

## Remarks

The handle returned is valid until the DRV\_ETHPHY\_Close routine is called. This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware. The intent parameter is not used. The PHY driver implements a non-blocking behavior.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize function must have been called before calling this function.
