# TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FreeF Type

**Parent topic:**[MAC Driver Module](GUID-0C1AF471-66D4-472F-84AF-212E9E18B21D.md)

## C

```
typedef void (* TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FreeF)(TCPIP_MAC_PACKET* pPkt);
```

## Description

Packet Allocation Function: typedef void \(\*TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FreeF\)\(TCPIP\_MAC\_PACKET\* pPkt\);

This function is used by the MAC to free a previously allocated TCPIP\_MAC\_PACKET packet.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|pPkt|Pointer to a previously allocated packet.|

## Returns

None.

## Remarks

The function will free a previously allocated packet. However packets or segments marked with TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_FLAG\_STATIC/TCPIP\_MAC\_SEG\_FLAG\_STATIC are not freed.

Also note that this function does not free explicitly the external segment payload. A payload that was created contiguously when the segment was created will be automatically freed by this function.

The debug version adds the module identifier.
