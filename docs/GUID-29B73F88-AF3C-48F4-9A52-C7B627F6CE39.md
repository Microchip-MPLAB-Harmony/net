## C

```
typedef uint8_t SNMP_INDEX;
```

## Description

Type: SNMP\_INDEX.

The current version limits the size of the index to 7 bits wide, meaning that such arrays can contain up to 127 entries.

## Remarks

SequenceVar - This command is part of Microchip MIB script declares a previously defined OID variable as a sequence variable and assigns an index to it. A sequence variable can contain an array of values and any instance of its values can be referenced by an index. More than one sequence variable may share a single index, creating multi dimensional arrays.

More than one index variable is not supported by mib2bib.jar compiler.
