# TCPIP\_SMTP\_Put Function

**Parent topic:**[SMTP Module](GUID-2B9B587D-5018-4CA9-AA8D-2395A2D004A5.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_SMTP_Put(
    char c
);
```

## Description

This function writes a single byte to the SMTP client.

## Preconditions

TCPIP\_SMTP\_UsageBegin\(\) returned true on a previous call.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|c|The byte to be written.|

## Returns

None.

## Remarks

This function is obsolete and will be eventually removed. TCPIP\_SMTP\_ArrayPut\(\) and TCPIP\_SMTP\_StringPut\(\) should be used.

This function cannot be used on an encrypted connection. It is difficult to estimate the amount of TX buffer space needed when transmitting byte by byte, which could cause intermediary write operations to the underlying TCP socket.

This function should only be called externally when the SMTP client is generating an on-the-fly message \(i.e., TCPIP\_SMTP\_MailSend\(\) was called with SMTPClient.Body set to NULL\).
