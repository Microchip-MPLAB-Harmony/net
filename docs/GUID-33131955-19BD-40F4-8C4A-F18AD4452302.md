# DRV\_ETHPHY\_Reset Function

**Parent topic:**[Ethernet PHY Driver Library](GUID-F4DF749A-0F8C-4482-8661-C005A0BE0CF4.md)

## C

```
DRV_ETHPHY_RESULT DRV_ETHPHY_Reset(DRV_HANDLE handle, bool waitComplete); 
```

## Returns

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_PENDING for ongoing, in progress operation

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_OPERATION\_ERR - invalid parameter or operation in the current context


## Description

This function immediately resets the Ethernet PHY, optionally waiting for a reset to complete.

## Remarks

Use DRV\_ETHPHY\_ClientStatus\(\) and DRV\_ETHPHY\_ClientOperationResult\(\) to check when the operation was completed and its outcome. When operation is completed but failed, DRV\_ETHPHY\_ClientOperationResult will return:

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_RES\_DTCT\_ERR if the PHY failed to respond


## Preconditions

-   The DRV\_ETHPHY\_Initialize routine must have been called.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid device handle.

-   DRV\_ETHPHY\_Setup must have been called to properly configure the PHY
