# TCPIP\_IPV6\_DASSourceAddressSelect Function

**Parent topic:**[IPv6 Module](GUID-F2484EF9-7914-43EE-A5B7-4FFDC27C8135.md)

## C

```
IPV6_ADDR_STRUCT * TCPIP_IPV6_DASSourceAddressSelect(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNetIf, 
    const IPV6_ADDR * dest, 
    IPV6_ADDR * requestedSource
);
```

## Description

The IPv6 policy table is used to select the destination address. The destination address selection algorithm takes a list of IPv6 addresses \(*gPolicyTable*\) and sorts the linked list. There are eight sorting rules. Starting with the last rule and working to the most important, using a stable sorting algorithm, will produce a sorted list most efficiently. The best average run time we'll get with a stable sort with O\(1\) memory usage is O\(n^2\), so we'll use an insertion sort. This will usually be most efficient for small lists \(which should be the typical case\). If a rule determines a result, then the remaining rules are not relevant and should be ignored.

## Preconditions

TCPIP\_IPV6\_Initialize\(\) is required. TCPIP\_IPV6\_InterfaceIsReady should be true.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hNetIf|The given interface.|
|dest|The destination address.|
|requestedSource|A specified source.|

## Returns

IPV6\_ADDR \*

-   Pointer to the selected source address - On Success.

-   NULL - On Failure.


## Remarks

None.
