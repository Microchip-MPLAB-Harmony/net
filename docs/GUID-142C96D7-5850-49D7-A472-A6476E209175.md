**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
bool TCPIP_STACK_NetDown(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH
);
```

## Description

This function performs the deinitialization of a net interface. As part of this process, the corresponding MAC driver is deinitialized.

## Preconditions

The TCP/IP stack should have been initialized by TCPIP\_STACK\_Initialize\(\) and the TCPIP\_STACK\_Status\(\) returned SYS\_STATUS\_READY. The network interface should be up and running.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|netH|Interface handle.|

## Returns

-   True - If success.

-   False - If no such network interface or the interface is already down.


## Remarks

If the interface to be brought down is a primary interface, then all its aliases will be brought down as well. If the interface to be brought down as an alias interface, then other interfaces won't be affected.
