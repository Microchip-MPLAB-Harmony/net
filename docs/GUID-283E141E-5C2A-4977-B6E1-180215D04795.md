# TCPIP\_IPV6\_PayloadSet Function

**Parent topic:**[IPv6 Module](GUID-F2484EF9-7914-43EE-A5B7-4FFDC27C8135.md)

## C

```
unsigned short TCPIP_IPV6_PayloadSet(
    IPV6_PACKET * pkt, 
    uint8_t* payload, 
    unsigned short len
);
```

## Description

This function will allocate a data segment header and append it to the end of a chain of segments in a TX packet. It will set the data pointer in the packet segment to a pre-existing buffer of data.

## Preconditions

TCPIP\_IPV6\_Initialize\(\) should be called. TCPIP\_IPV6\_InterfaceIsReady should be true.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|ptrPacket|The packet.|
|payload|Address of the data payload.|
|len|Length of the data payload.|

## Returns

IPV6\_ADDR \*

-   The amount of data added to the packet length - On Success.

-   0 - On Failure.


## Remarks

This function is useful for adding payloads to outgoing packets without copying them if the data is in another pre-existing buffer \(i.e., TCP\).
