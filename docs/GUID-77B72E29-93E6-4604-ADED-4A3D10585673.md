## C

```
typedef struct {
    const char* lowSsmAddress;
    const char* highSsmAddress;
    int reportInterval;
    int nInterfaces;
    int nSockets;

```

## Description

Structure: TCPIP\_IGMP\_MODULE\_CONFIG. This structure defines IGMP module run-time configuration/initialization data.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|lowSsmAddress|The lower limit of the SSM range. if 0, the default value IANA 232.0.0.1 is used.|
|highSsmAddress|The high limit of the SSM range. if 0, default value IANA 232.255.255.255 is used.|
|reportInterval|Unsolicited report interval, ms - default 1 second. The unsolicited report interval is the time between repetitions of a host's initial report of membership in a group. RFC 3376 IGMPv3 default is 1 second.|
|nInterfaces|The \(maximum\) number of interfaces that support IGMP multicast. The minimum between this number and the actual number of present interfaces when the stack is initialized will be selected.|
|nSockets|Maximum number of sockets that can subscibe to IGMP.|
|nGroups|The \(maximum\) number of multicast groups \(multicast destination addresses\) that the IGMP module can accomodate.|
|nGroupSources|The \(maximum\) number of sources that can belong to a group.|
|nSourceSockets|Maximum number of different sockets that could listen on a source as part of a group.|

## Remarks

Currently the dynamic implementation is not supported.
