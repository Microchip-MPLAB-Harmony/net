# TCPIP\_UDP\_ClientOpen Function

**Parent topic:**[UDP Module](GUID-D2D8E9C8-0778-41E2-8F0B-194954B92250.md)

## C

```
UDP_SOCKET TCPIP_UDP_ClientOpen(IP_ADDRESS_TYPE addType, UDP_PORT remotePort, IP_MULTI_ADDRESS* remoteAddress); 
```

## Returns

-   INVALID\_SOCKET - No sockets of the specified type were available to be opened.

-   A UDP\_SOCKET handle - Save this handle and use it when calling all other UDP APIs.


## Description

Provides a unified method for opening UDP client sockets.

## Remarks

Sockets and user threads protection For efficiency reasons, there is NO PROTECTION for each individual API call except to Open and Close sockets! What it means is that:

-   the user application should close all its sockets before issuing a stack/if down command The stack manager takes care of the internally used sockets

-   A socket can NOT be used concurrently from multiple threads! It's ok to pass a socket from one thread to another as long as there's is no access from more than one thread at a time


## Preconditions

UDP is initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE|addType The type of address being used. Example: IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV4 or IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_IPV6. It can also be IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_ANY if the type of the socket will be specified later \(using TCPIP\_UDP\_Bind, TCPIP\_UDP\_RemoteBind\).|
|UDP\_PORT|remotePort The remote UDP port to which a connection should be made. The local port for client sockets will be automatically picked by the UDP module.|
|IP\_MULTI\_ADDRESS\*|remoteAddress The remote address to connect to. Not used if addType == IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_ANY. Can be NULL if later set by a call to TCPIP\_UDP\_RemoteBind.|
