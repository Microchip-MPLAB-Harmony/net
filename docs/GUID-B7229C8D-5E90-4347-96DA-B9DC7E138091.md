# TCPIP\_DHCPS\_LeaseRemove Function

**Parent topic:**[DHCP Server Module \(V2\)](GUID-EE292D18-2DE6-478E-AAE1-74C69A31459E.md)

## C

TCPIP\_DHCPS\_RES TCPIP\_DHCPS\_LeaseRemove\(TCPIP\_NET\_HANDLE netH, uint16\_t leaseIx, bool keepAddBusy\);

## Description

**Summary**

```
Remove one entry from the DHCP server DB  
```

**Description**

```
This function is used to remove one entry from the DB of the selected interface  
```

**Precondition**

```
The DHCP Server module should have been initialized.  
```

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hNet|selected interface handle|
|leaseIx|lease index|
|keepAddBusy|- if true, the corresponding IP address \(if the entry exists\) will continue to be marked as busy|
||and it won't be used for other client leases|
||- otherwise, the IP address will be marked as available|
||This should be the default|

## Returns

*- TCPIP\_DHCPS\_RES\_OK* - if the selected entry was found and deleted from the selected interface

*- < 0* - if wrong interface or DHCP server is not running on that interface, or wrong/unused index

*- TCPIP\_DHCPS\_RES\_ACCESS\_LOCKED* - if access to the DHCP server DB is locked by another thread and the the call can be retried. Multi-threaded access is enabled \(build symbol TCPIP\_DHCPS\_MULTI\_THREADED\_ACCESS != 0\)

**Remarks**

```
Function exists only when build symbol TCPIP_DHCPS_DYNAMIC_DB_ACCESS != 0 

The function will delete permanent leases too.

When a server lease is removed, a corresponding client (if exists) will still hold a valid lease.
When the client eventually contacts the server to renew its lease the operation will fail
as the server has no knwoledge of the client lease.
