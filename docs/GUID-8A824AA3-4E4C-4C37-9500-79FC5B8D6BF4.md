## C

```
typedef struct {
uint16_t entrySize;
uint16_t nBlocks;
uint8_t nExpBlks;
} TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_POOL_ENTRY;
```

## Description

Internal pool configuration data.

This data type defines the data required to initialize the TCP/IP stack internal memory pool.

## Preconditions

None.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|entrySize|Size of the blocks in this pool entry.|
|nBlocks|Number of blocks to create for this entry.|
|nExpBlks|Number of blocks to expand/allocate when an allocation in this entry failed.|

## Remarks

Pool entries should follow these 2 rules:

-   They should have distincy block sizes: *entrySize*. Multiple entries having the same *entrySize* is not supported.

-   Pool entries should have a non-zero block size. Entries with 0 block size are not supported.


If these conditions are not observed, the heap creation will fail. To expand/dynamically allocate at run time the *expansionHeapSize* needs to be != 0; If *nExpBlks* == 0, then no allocation will be tried for this particular entry.
