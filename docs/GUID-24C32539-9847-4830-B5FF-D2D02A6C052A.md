# TCPIP\_IPV4\_PacketOptionFieldSet Function

**Parent topic:**[IPv4 Module](GUID-EA29E72F-4194-41F9-9F19-D8BBA00D62F2.md)

## C

```
IPV4_OPTION_FIELD* TCPIP_IPV4_PacketOptionFieldSet(
    IPV4_PACKET* pPkt, 
    uint16_t optionLen, 
    bool firstOption
);
```

## Description

This function is a helper to allow setting a specific option into an IPv4 packet that supports options. It is meant for supporting user controlled and variable size options.

## Preconditions

IPv4 properly initialized. *pPkt* properly created with TCPIP\_IPV4\_PacketAlloc\(\).

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|pPkt|A packet allocated with TCPIP\_IPV4\_PacketALloc\(\).|
|optionLen|Size for the option to set, in bytes. This is the size of the whole IPV4\_OPTION\_FIELD, the option data included.|
|firstOption|Specifies that this is the first option to be set to the packet.|

## Returns

-   A valid IPV4\_OPTION\_FIELD pointer that the caller can use to set the IPv4 option fields.

-   0 - Invalid packet or the option field cannot hold the required option size.


## Remarks

This function should be called for unsupported options or for options that have variable data. It doesn't have to be used for standard supported options \(TCPIP\_IPV4\_OPTION\_ROUTER\_ALERT, for ex.\)

The packet should have been allocated with enough option space using TCPIP\_IPV4\_PacketAlloc\(\).

Sequential calls can be made using *firstOption* true for the first call and false for the subsequent calls.

When setting the option data, *optionLen* MUST NOT be exceeded.

If the option doesn't take a multiple of 4 bytes, it should be padded with the NOP option \(0x01\).
