## Description

Type: TCPIP\_TFTPC\_EVENT\_HANDLER.

Prototype of a TFTPC event handler. Clients can register a handler with the TFTP service. Once an TFTP event occurs the TFTP Client service will be called the registered handler. The handler has to be short and fast. It is meant for setting an event flag, not for lengthy processing. buf - Buffer is used to provide the memory Pointer. buf type need to be typecasted to char\* while processing bufLen - The number of bytes present in the buffer.
