## C

```
typedef struct {
int nRxOkPackets;

int nRxFragmentErrors;
int nRxBuffNotAvailable;
} TCPIP_MAC_RX_STATISTICS;
```

## Description

MAC RX Statistics Data.

This structure defines the RX statistics data for the MAC driver.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|nRxOkPackets|Number of OK RX packets.|
|nRxPendBuffers|Number of unacknowledged pending RX buffers in the driver queues. If each incoming packet fits within a RX buffer \(the RX buffer is large enough\) than this corresponds to the number of unacknowledged pending RX packets. Otherwise the number of packets is less than the pending buffers.|
|nRxSchedBuffers|Number of currently scheduled RX buffers in the driver queues. These are available buffers, ready to receive data.|
|nRxErrorPackets|Number of RX packets with errors.|
|nRxFragmentErrors|Number of RX fragmentation errors.|
|nRxBuffNotAvailable|Number of occurences of 'RX Buffer Not Available'.|

## Remarks

This statistics are recorded by the driver, not by the hardware.
