**Parent topic:**[IPv4 Module](GUID-EA29E72F-4194-41F9-9F19-D8BBA00D62F2.md)

## C

```
typedef enum {
TCPIP_IPV4_FILTER_NONE = 0x00,
TCPIP_IPV4_FILTER_UNICAST = 0x01,
TCPIP_IPV4_FILTER_BROADCAST = 0x02,
TCPIP_IPV4_FILTER_MULTICAST = 0x04
} TCPIP_IPV4_FILTER_TYPE;
```

## Description

IPv4 packet filters.

This is the list of the packet filters that are supported by this IPv4 implementation. There are 3 types of IPv4 packets currently supported:

-   unicast

-   broadcast

-   multicast


An IPV4 packet is accepted if the filter corresponding to the packet type is not set.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|TCPIP\_IPV4\_FILTER\_NONE = 0x00|No packet filter active. All packets are accepted.|
|TCPIP\_IPV4\_FILTER\_UNICAST = 0x01|Unicast packets will be filtered out.|
|TCPIP\_IPV4\_FILTER\_BROADCAST = 0x02|Broadcast packets will be filtered out.|
|TCPIP\_IPV4\_FILTER\_MULTICAST = 0x04|Multicast packets will be filtered out.|

## Returns

None.

## Remarks

Multiple filters can be set.

If no filter is set, all packets are accepted; this is the default case.
