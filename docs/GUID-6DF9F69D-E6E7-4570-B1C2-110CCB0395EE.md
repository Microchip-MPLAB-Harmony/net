# TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPE Enumeration

**Parent topic:**[Manager Module](GUID-B37C4F4C-DC2D-48D9-9909-AACBA987B57A.md)

## C

```
typedef enum {
TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_TYPE_NONE = 0,
TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_TYPE_INTERNAL_HEAP,
TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_TYPE_INTERNAL_HEAP_POOL,
TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_TYPE_EXTERNAL_HEAP,
TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_TYPES
} TCPIP_STACK_HEAP_TYPE;
```

## Description

Enumeration: TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPE.

Definition of the heap type which the TCP/IP stack uses for internal allocation. Stack clients could use the type to get access to heap statistics functions.

## Preconditions

None.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPE\_NONE = 0|Invalid, unknown heap type.|
|TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPE\_INTERNAL\_HEAP|Internally implemented heap. Currently the default heap type. The default internal memory heap consists of blocks of data that are allocated in chunks using a first fit algorithm. Allocation and deallocation operations are reasonably fast. However, the allocation granularity is pretty good. This type of heap can become fragmented over time. There is no data maintained in this heap on a per client basis. What this means is that it is OK to pass the heap handle to other clients \(software modules\) to use it.|
|TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPE\_INTERNAL\_HEAP\_POOL|Internally implemented pool heap. Very fast allocation and deallocation without fragmentation. However, the allocated chunks are fixed size so it can result in a not very efficient memory usage.|
|TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPE\_EXTERNAL\_HEAP|Externally maintained heap. The heap is maintained externally and allocation is done using the supplied functions. The TCP/IP stack heap can provide OSAL synchronization protection if needed.|
|TCPIP\_STACK\_HEAP\_TYPES|Number of supported heap types.|

## Remarks

New types could be added in the future.
