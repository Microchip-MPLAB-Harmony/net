The current number of valid entries for an address is given by TCPIP\_DNS\_GetIPAddressesNumber\(\). A valid index is \[0, TCPIP\_DNS\_GetIPAddressesNumber\(IP\_ADDRESS\_TYPE\_4\)\).|
|pIPv4Addr|Pointer to array of IPv4 addresses to store the host 4 addresses.|
|nIPv4Addresses|Number of IPv46 addresses in the p4Addr array.|
