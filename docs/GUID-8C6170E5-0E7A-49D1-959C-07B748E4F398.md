## Description

MAC Packet Acknowledge Result.

This enumeration contains the list of MAC codes used for a packet acknowledgment.

## Members

|Members|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_NONE = 0|Packet result unknown, unspecified.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_TX\_OK = 1|TX success code - packet was transmitted successfully.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_RX\_OK = 2|RX success code - packet was received/processed successfully.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_LINK\_DOWN = -1|TX:packet was dropped because the link was down.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_NET\_DOWN = -2|TX:packet was dropped because the network is down.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_BUFFER\_ERR = -3|TX:packet was dropped because the buffer type is not supported.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_ARP\_TMO = -4|TX:packet was dropped because of an ARP timeout.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_ARP\_NET\_ERR = -5|TX:packet associated interface is down or non existent.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_MAC\_REJECT\_ERR = -6|TX:packet rejected by MAC.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_CHKSUM\_ERR = -10|RX: packet was dropped because the checksum was incorrect.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_SOURCE\_ERR = -11|RX: packet was dropped because of wrong interface source address.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_DEST\_ERR = -12|RX: packet was dropped because of wrong destination address.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_TYPE\_ERR = -13|RX: packet was dropped because the type was unknown.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_STRUCT\_ERR = -14|RX: internal packet structure error.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_PROTO\_DEST\_ERR = -15|RX: the packet protocol couldn't find a destination for it.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_FRAGMENT\_ERR = -16|RX: the packet too fragmented.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_PROTO\_DEST\_CLOSE = -17|RX: the packet destination is closing.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_ALLOC\_ERR = -18|RX: memory allocation error.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_IP\_REJECT\_ERR = -19|RX/TX: Packet was rejected by the IP layer.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_EXTERN = -20|RX: packet was dropped because it was processed externally.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_BRIDGE\_DONE = -21|RX: packet was directly processed successfuly by the bridge.|
|TCPIP\_MAC\_PKT\_ACK\_BRIDGE\_DISCARD = -22|RX: packet was dropped by the bridge.|

## Remarks

16 bits only acknowledge results are supported. Positive codes indicate success. Negative codes indicate a failure of some sort.
