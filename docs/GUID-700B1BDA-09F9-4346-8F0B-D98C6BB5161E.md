# TCPIP\_ARP\_Probe Function

**Parent topic:**[ARP Module](GUID-3DCBF1EB-5623-4419-B244-DDD9B01704EE.md)

## C

```
TCPIP_ARP_RESULT TCPIP_ARP_Probe(
    TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNet, 
    IPV4_ADDR* IPAddr, 
    IPV4_ADDR* srcAddr, 
    TCPIP_ARP_OPERATION_TYPE opType
);
```

## Description

This function transmits and ARP probe to determine the hardware address of a given IP address. The packet will use the type of operation and the source address specified as parameters.

## Preconditions

The ARP module should have been initialized.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|hNet|Interface to use.|
|IPAddr|The IP address to be resolved. The address must be specified in network byte order \(big endian\).|
|srcAddr|The source address to be used in the ARP packet.|
|opType|Operation code to be set in the outgoing ARP packet.|

## Returns

-   ARP\_RES\_ENTRY\_SOLVED - if the required entry is already solved.

-   ARP\_RES\_ENTRY\_QUEUED - if the required entry was already queued.

-   ARP\_RES\_ENTRY\_NEW - if the operation succeeded and a new entry was added \(and queued for resolving\).

-   ARP\_RES\_CACHE\_FULL - if new entry could not be inserted, the cache was full.

-   ARP\_RES\_BAD\_ADDRESS - bad address specified.

-   ARP\_RES\_NO\_INTERFACE - no such interface.


## Remarks

This function is a more advanced version of TCPIP\_ARP\_Resolve. It allows the caller to specify the operation type and the source address of the outgoing ARP packet. It also supports the ARP flags defined in TCPIP\_ARP\_OPERATION\_TYPE.

No check is done for IPAddr to be valid.

To retrieve the ARP query result, call the TCPIP\_ARP\_IsResolved function.
