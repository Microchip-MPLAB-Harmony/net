/* Function:
    USB_ERROR USB_DEVICE_IRPSubmit
    (
        USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle, 
        USB_ENDPOINT endpointAndDirection, 
        USB_DEVICE_IRP * irp
    );
    
  Summary:
    This function submits an I/O Request Packet (IRP) for processing to the
    Hi-Speed USB Driver.
	
  Description:
    This function submits an I/O Request Packet (IRP) for processing to the USB
    Driver. The IRP allows a client to send and receive data from the USB Host.
    The data will be sent or received through the specified endpoint. The direction
    of the data transfer is indicated by the direction flag in the
    endpointAndDirection parameter. Submitting an IRP arms the endpoint to
    either send data to or receive data from the Host.  If an IRP is already
    being processed on the endpoint, the subsequent IRP submit operation
    will be queued. The contents of the IRP (including the application buffers)
    should not be changed until the IRP has been processed.
    
    Particular attention should be paid to the size parameter of IRP. The
    following should be noted:
    
      * The size parameter while sending data to the Host can be less than,
        greater than, equal to, or be an exact multiple of the maximum packet size
        for the endpoint. The maximum packet size for the endpoint determines
        the number of transactions required to process the IRP.
      * If the size parameter, while sending data to the Host is less than the
        maximum packet size, the transfer will complete in one transaction.
      * If the size parameter, while sending data to the Host is greater
        than the maximum packet size, the IRP will be processed in multiple
        transactions.
      * If the size parameter, while sending data to the Host is equal to or
        an exact multiple of the maximum packet size, the client can optionally
        ask the driver to send a Zero Length Packet(ZLP) by specifying the
        USB_DEVICE_IRP_FLAG_DATA_COMPLETE flag as the flag parameter.
      * The size parameter, while receiving data from the Host must be an
        exact multiple of the maximum packet size of the endpoint. If this is
        not the case, the driver will return a USB_ERROR_IRP_SIZE_INVALID
        result. If while processing the IRP, the driver receives less than
        maximum packet size or a ZLP from the Host, the driver considers the
        IRP as processed. The size parameter at this point contains the actual
        amount of data received from the Host. The IRP status is returned as
        USB_DEVICE_IRP_STATUS_COMPLETED_SHORT.
      * If a ZLP needs to be sent to Host, the IRP size should be specified
        as 0 and the flag parameter should be set as
        USB_DEVICE_IRP_FLAG_DATA_COMPLETE.
      * If the IRP size is an exact multiple of the endpoint size, the client
        can request the driver to not send a ZLP by setting the flag parameter
        to USB_DEVICE_IRP_FLAG_DATA_PENDING. This flag indicates that there is
        more data pending in this transfer.
      * Specifying a size less than the endpoint size along with the
        USB_DEVICE_IRP_FLAG_DATA_PENDING flag will cause the driver to return a
        USB_ERROR_IRP_SIZE_INVALID.
      * If the size is greater than but not a multiple of the endpoint size, and
        the flag is specified as USB_DEVICE_IRP_FLAG_DATA_PENDING, the driver
        will send multiple of endpoint size number of bytes. For example, if the
        IRP size is 130 and the endpoint size if 64, the number of bytes sent
        will 128.
		
  Precondition:
    The Device Layer handle should be valid.
	
  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle - Pointer to the device layer handle that is returned from 
                      USB_DEVICE_Open() function.
    endpointAndDirection -  Specifies the endpoint and direcon.
    irp - Pointer to the IRP to be added to the queue for processing.
	
  Returns:
    * USB_ERROR_NONE - if the IRP was submitted successful.
    * USB_ERROR_IRP_SIZE_INVALID - if the size parameter of the IRP is not
      correct. 
    * USB_ERROR_PARAMETER_INVALID - If the client handle is not valid.
    * USB_ERROR_ENDPOINT_NOT_CONFIGURED - If the endpoint is not enabled.
    * USB_ERROR_DEVICE_ENDPOINT_INVALID - The specified endpoint is not valid.
    * USB_ERROR_OSAL_FUNCTION - An OSAL call in the function did not complete
      successfully.
	
  Example:
    <code>
    // The following code shows an example of how to schedule a IRP to send data
    // from a device to the Host. Assume that the max packet size is 64 and
    // and this data needs to sent over Endpoint 1. In this example, the

    // following example, the USB_DEVICE_IRPSubmit function will return a
    // USB_DEVICE_IRP_SIZE_INVALID value.

  Summary:
    This function cancels the specific IRP that are queued and in progress at the
    specified endpoint.
	
  Description:
    This function attempts to cancel the processing of a queued IRP. An IRP that
    was in the queue but yet to be processed will be cancelled successfully and
    the IRP callback function will be called from this function with the
    USB_DEVICE_IRP_STATUS_ABORTED status. The application can release the data
    buffer memory used by the IRP when this callback occurs.  If the IRP was in
    progress (a transaction in on the bus) when the cancel function was called,
    the IRP will be canceled only when an ongoing or the next transaction has
    completed. The IRP callback function will then be called in an interrupt
    context. The application should not release the related data buffer unless
    the IRP callback has occurred.
	
  Precondition:
    The Client handle should be valid.
	
  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle - Pointer to the device layer handle that is returned from 
                      USB_DEVICE_Open() function.
    irp - Pointer to the IRP to cancel.
	
  Returns:
    * USB_ERROR_NONE - The IRP have been canceled successfully.
    * USB_ERROR_PARAMETER_INVALID - Invalid parameter or the IRP already has 
      been aborted or completed
    * USB_ERROR_OSAL_FUNCTION - An OSAL function called in this function did
      not execute successfully.

  Remarks:
    The size returned after the ABORT callback will be always 0 regardless of

    assume any data transaction has happened for an canceled IRP.  If the last
    transaction of the IRP was in progress, the IRP cancel does not have
    any effect. The first transaction of any ongoing IRP cannot be canceled.
