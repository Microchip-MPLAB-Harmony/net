 * And, when we do that, the FAT FS code expects an array named "VolToPart".
 * The explanation for each element of the array is given below, and
 * this function places the elements of this array.
 *
 * Lets consider a case where 2 media are attached = SD card with 4 partitions
 * and NVM with 1 partition.
