<h1>Login Successful</h1>

<p>You have successfully logged in to the web server.  This authentication
is valid until you close your browser.</p>

<p>Credentials are verified in your own custom callback function called
<code>TCPIP_HTTP_UserAuthenticate</code>.  In here, you can determine if the supplied
user name and password are valid for access to the requested page.  You can
add multiple users and restrict different users to different pages.</p>

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise:</b> Change the user name and password in
<code>TCPIP_HTTP_UserAuthenticate</code> to one of your choosing.  (The callback is
located in <code>custom_http_app.c</code>.)</p>

combination.
