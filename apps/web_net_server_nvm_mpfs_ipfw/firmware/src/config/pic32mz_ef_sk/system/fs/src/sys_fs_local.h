/*Function:
    bool _SYS_FS_StringWildCardCompare(const char * ptr1, const char *ptr2)

    Summary:
    Compares the 2 file names with wild character.

    Description:
        Compares the 2 file names with wild character. This is required for
        file search of a directory.

    Precondition:
        Atlesat, one disk has to be mounted before this funcion could be set.


    Parameters:
        ptr1            - First file name. This can have wild characters (*, ?).

        ptr2     	- Second file name. This should be complete file name.
                          No wild char should be passed here.


    Returns:
        If comparison is success	-	true

        If comparison is failure	-	false

  Remarks:
	None
