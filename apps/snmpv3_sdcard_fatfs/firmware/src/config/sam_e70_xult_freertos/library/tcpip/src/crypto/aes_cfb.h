 v1.0   Original release - released with AN1044

 v2.0   Updated to support 192-bit and 256-bit modes.  API change to be
        compatible with PIC32 implementation.  This increases RAM usage but
        decreases the decode time.

  Description:
    The AES_CFB_STATE_DATA structure contains state information that needs to be
    retained between blocks of CFB data.  This structure is also used to pass
    some initialization data to the first block of a new stream.

       not be touched.  This buffer is used to hold intermediate data. */

  Summary:
    Encrypts a specified amount of data using cipher feedback (CFB) mode.

  Description:
    Encrypts a specified amount of data using cipher feedback (CFB) mode.

  Precondition:
    * p_cfb_state_data->intial_vector must be populated with the initialization vector before the first call of this function on a new data stream.
    * p_cfb_state_data->round_keys must be initialized to point to the round_keys before the first call of this function on a new data stream.
    * round_keys must be properly generated using AESCreateRoundKeys().
  Parameters:
    cipher_text      - [out] pointer to the buffer where the encrypted data sould reside.  It must also be the same length as the plain_text buffer.
    plain_text       - [in]  pointer to the data that needs to be encrypted.
    num_bytes        - [in]  the number of bytes in the plain_text and cipher_text buffers
    round_keys       - [in]  pointer to the round key buffer that will be used
                       for this encryption cycle.
    p_cfb_state_data - [in]  pointer to an instance of the AES_CFB_STATE_DATA for this stream.  The first call of this function should have the p_cfb_state_data->initial_vector set to the initialization vector.
    options          - [in]  Set of options that are ORed together (e.g. - AES_CIPHER_TEXT_POINTER_ALIGNED | AES_STREAM_START).  Valid options are\: 
                            * AES_STREAM_START
                            * AES_STREAM_COMPLETE
