/* SYS FS Media Block Command Handle

  Summary:
    Handle identifying block commands of the media.

  Description:
    A block command handle is returned by a call to the Read, Write, or Erase
    functions. This handle allows the application to track the completion of
    the operation. The handle is returned back to the client by the "event
    handler callback" function registered with the driver.

    The handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has been
    notified of the completion of the operation (after event handler function
    that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been retired by
    the driver if no event handler callback was set.

  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    Gets the starting media address based on a disk number.

  Description:
    This function gets the starting address of a media. This function is
    intended to work only with MPFS2, which does byte addressing and needs a
    memory address (not disk number).
 
  Precondition:
     None.
 
  Parameters:
     diskNo         - media number
 
  Returns:
     Memory address of type uintptr_t.

  Summary:
    Register the event handler for Mount/Un-Mount events.

  Parameters:
    eventHandler - FS Client event handler pointer
    context - FS Client context

  Description:
    This function is used to register a FS client event handler for notifying the
    Mount/Un-Mount events when AutoMount feature is enabled for File system.

    On Mount/Un-Mount of a volume all the registered clients will be notified.
    The client should check if the mount name passed when event handler is called
    is the one it is expecting and then proceed.

  Note:
    This API should not be called directly from Application. Application should use
    SYS_FS_EventHandlerSet() instead.

    This API is Available only when SYS_FS_AUTOMOUNT_ENABLE is set to true.

    See sys_fs.h for usage information.
