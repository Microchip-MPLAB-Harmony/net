  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of simultaneous operations for an instance.

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of simultaneous operations
    that can be supported by this driver.

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of clients.

  Description:
    This definition select the MIIM Maximum Number of Clients per instance.

  Remarks:
    By default the 1st MIIM client is the DRV_ETHPHY.

/* MIIM client Operation Protection

  Summary:
    Enables/Disables Client Operation Protection feature.

  Description:
    Because of the recirculation of the operation handles and client handles
    the possibility exists that a misbehaved client inadvertently gets the results
    of a previous completed operations that now belongs to a different client.
    When this feature is enabled, extra protection is added for an operation handle
    to uniquely identify a client that has started the operation and extra check is done
    that operation belongs to the client that asks for the result.


  Remarks:
    Set the value to 1 to enable, 0 to disable the feature.

    Enabling this feature requires a small overhead in code and data size.

/* MIIM PHY Commands

  Summary:
    Enables/Disables MIIM commands feature.

  Description:
    Adds a MIIM command to the TCP/IP command menu allowing to read/write
    a PHY register.

  Remarks:
    Set the value to 1 to enable, 0 to disable the feature.

    Currently the MIIM commands are integrated in the TCP/IP commands.
    To have the MIIM commands available the TCP/IP commands need to be enabled.
