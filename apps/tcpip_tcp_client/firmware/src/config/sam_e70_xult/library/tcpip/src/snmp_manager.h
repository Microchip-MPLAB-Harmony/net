  Function:
    bool TCPIP_SNMP_Initialize(void)

  Summary:
    Initialize SNMP module internals.

  Description:
    This function initializes the SNMP agent. One UDP socket is initialized
    and opened at port 161. Agent will receive and transmit all the SNMP
    PDUs on this UDP socket.

  Precondition:
    At least one UDP socket must be available. TCPIP_UDP_Initialize() is already called.

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    None

  Remarks:
    This function is called only once during lifetime of the application.
    One UDP socket will be used.
