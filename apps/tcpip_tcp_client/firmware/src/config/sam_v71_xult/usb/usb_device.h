/* USB Device Layer Events.

  Summary:
    USB Device Layer Events.

  Description:
    This enumeration lists the possible events that the device layer can
    generate. The client should register an event handler of the type
    USB_DEVICE_EVENT_HANDLER to receive device layer events. The contents of
    pData in the event handler depends on the generated event. Refer to the
    description of the event for details on data provided along with that event.
    The events generated are device layer instance specific.

    The client will receive control transfers for handling from the device
    layer, where the recipient field of the Control Transfer Setup packet is set
    to Other. The client can use the control transfer events and the Device
    Layer control transfer functions to complete such control transfers. 

    It is not mandatory for the client application to handle the control
    transfer event within the event handler. Indeed, it may be possible that the
    data stage of the control transfer requires extended processing. Because the
    event handler executes in an interrupt context, it is recommended to keep
    the processing in the event handler to a minimum. The client application can
    call the USB_DEVICE_ControlSend, USB_DEVICE_ControlReceive and
    USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus functions after returning from the event handler,
    thus deferring the control transfer event handling and responses. 

    Note that a USB host will typically wait for control transfer response for a
    finite time duration before timing out and canceling the transfer and
    associated transactions. Even when deferring response, the application must
    respond promptly if such timeouts have to be avoided. 

    The client must use the USB_DEVICE_EventHandlerSet function to register
    the event handler call back function. The following code example shows the
	handling of the USB Device Layer Events.

    <code>
    USB_DEVICE_EVENT_RESPONSE APP_USBDeviceEventHandler

    )

  Summary:
    Opens the specified USB device layer instance and returns a handle to it.

  Description:
    This function opens the USB device layer instance specified by instance
    index and returns a handle. This handle must be provided to all other client
    operations to identify the caller and the instance of the USB device layer.
    An instance of the Device Layer can be opened only once. Trying to open the
    Device Layer more than once will return a invalid device layer handle.

  Precondition:
    This function must be called after USB device driver initialization
    and after the initialization of USB Device Layer.

  Parameters:
    instanceIndex   - USB device layer instance index
    intent          - This parameter is ignored. The Device Layer will always
                      open in read/write and exclusive mode.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid device layer handle. Otherwise, it 
    returns USB_DEVICE_HANDLE_INVALID. 

  Example:
    <code>
    // This code example shows how the 
    // USB Device Layer can be opened.
    
    USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle;
    
    // Before opening a handle, USB device must have been initialized

  Description:
    This function closes an opened handle to an instance of the USB device layer,
    invalidating the handle.

  Precondition:
    The USB_DEVICE_Initialize function must have been called for the specified
    device layer instance. USB_DEVICE_Open must have been called to obtain a 
    valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from USB_DEVICE_Open

  Returns:
    None

  Example:

  Remarks:
    After calling this routine, the handle passed in "usbDevHandle" must not be used
    with any of the remaining driver routines.  A new handle must be obtained by
    calling USB_DEVICE_Open() before the client may use the device layer again.

  Summary:
    This function will start the resume signaling.

  Description:
    This function will start the resume signaling on the bus. The client calls
    this function after it has detected a idle bus (through the
    USB_DEVICE_EVENT_SUSPENDED event). The remote wake-up feature should have
    been enabled by the host, before the client can call this function. The
    client can use the USB_DEVICE_RemoteWakeupStatusGet function to check if
    the host has enabled the remote wake-up feature.

  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid.  The remote wake-up feature should have
    been enabled by the host.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle    - Client's driver handle (returned from USB_DEVICE_Open)

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // This code example shows how the device can enable and disable
    // Resume signaling on the bus. These function should only be called if the 
    // device support remote wakeup and the host has enabled this

    (
        USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle,
        void * data, 
        size_t length
    )

  Summary:
    Sends data stage of the control transfer from device to host.

  Description:
    This function allows the application to specify the data that would be sent
    to host in the data stage of a control read transfer. It should be called
    when the application has received the
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_TRANSFER_EVENT_SETUP_REQUEST event and has identified
    this setup request as the setup stage of a control read transfer. The Device
    Layer will generate a USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_TRANSFER_EVENT_DATA_SENT event when
    the data stage has completed. The function can be called in the Application
    Control Transfer Event handler or can be called after the application has
    returned from the control transfer event handler. 
    
    Calling this function after returning from the event handler defers the
    response to the event.  This allows the application to prepare the data
    buffer out of the event handler context, especially if the data buffer to
    receive the data is not readily available. Note however, that there are
    timing considerations when responding to the control transfer. Exceeding the
    response time will cause the host to cancel the control transfer and may
    cause USB host to reject the device.
 
  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle         - USB device handle returned by USB_DEVICE_Open

    data                    - Pointer to buffer that holds data

    )

  Summary:
    Initiates status stage of the control transfer.

  Description:
    This function allows the application to complete the status stage of the of
    an on-going control transfer. The application must call this function when
    the data stage of the control transfer is complete or when a Setup Request
    has been received (in case of a zero data stage control transfer). The
    application can either accept the data stage/setup command or reject it.
    Calling this function with status set to USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_OK will
    acknowledge the status stage of the control transfer. The control transfer
    can be stalled by setting the status parameter to
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_ERROR. 
    
    The function can be called in the Application Control Transfer event handler
    or can be called after returning from this event handler.  Calling this
    function after returning from the control transfer event handler defers the
    response to the event. This allows the application to analyze the event
    response outside the event handler. Note however, that there are timing
    considerations when responding to the control transfer. Exceeding the
    response time will cause the host to cancel the control transfer and may
    cause USB host to reject the device. 
    
    The application must be aware of events and associated control transfers
    that do or do not require data stages.  Incorrect usage of the
    USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus function could cause the device function to be
    non-compliant.

  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid. This function should only be called to 
	complete an on-going control transfer.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle        - USB device handle returned by USB_DEVICE_Open
    
    status                 - USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_OK to acknowledge the

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_TRANSFER_RESULT_FAILED - If control transfer failed 
    due to host aborting the previous control transfer.

    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_TRANSFER_RESULT_SUCCESS - The request was submitted
    successfully.

  Summary:
    This function requests a data write to a USB Device Endpoint.

  Description:
    This function requests a data write to the USB Device Endpoint. The function
    places a requests with Device layer, the request will get serviced as and
    when the data is requested by the USB Host. A handle to the request is
    returned in the transferHandle parameter. The termination of the request is
    indicated by the USB_DEVICE_EVENT_ENDPOINT_WRITE_COMPLETE event. The amount
    of data written and the transfer handle associated with the request is
    returned along with the event in length member of the pData parameter in the
    event handler. The transfer handle expires when event handler for the
    USB_DEVICE_EVENT_ENDPOINT_WRITE_COMPLETE exits.  If the write request could
    not be accepted, the function returns an error code and transferHandle will
    contain the value USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.
    
    The behavior of the write request depends on the flags and size parameter.
    If the application intends to send more data in a request, then it should
    use the USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING flag. If there is no
    more data to be sent in the request, the application must use the
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE flag. This is explained in more
    detail here:
    
    - If size is a multiple of maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the write function will append
    a Zero Length Packet (ZLP) to complete the transfer. 
    
    - If size is a multiple of maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING, the write function will
    not append a ZLP and hence will not complete the transfer. 
    
    - If size is greater than but not a multiple of maxPacketSize and flags is
    set as USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the write function complete
    the transfer without appending a ZLP. 
    
    - If size is greater than but not a multiple of maxPacketSize and flags is
    set as USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING, the write function
    returns an error code and sets the transferHandle parameter to 
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID. 
    
    - If size is less than maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the write function schedules
    one packet. 
    
    - If size is less than maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING, the write function
    returns an error code and sets the transferHandle parameter to 
    USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Precondition:
    The USB Device should be in a configured state.

  Parameters:
    instance  - Handle to the device layer.

    transferHandle  - Pointer to a USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE type of
                      variable. This variable will contain the transfer handle
                      in case the write request was successful.

    endpoint        - Endpoint to which the data should be written. Note that is
                      a combination of direction and the endpoint number. Refer 
                      to the description of USB_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS for more details.

    data            - Pointer to the data buffer that contains the data to written.

    size            - Size of the data buffer. Refer to the description section for more
                      details on how the size affects the transfer.

    flags           - Flags that indicate whether the transfer should continue or end.
                      Refer to the description for more details.

  Returns:

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_OK - The write request was successful. transferHandle
    contains a valid transfer handle.
    
    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_QUEUE_FULL - Internal request queue 
    is full. The write request could not be added.
    
    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_ENDPOINT_INVALID - Endpoint is not provisioned in
    the system.

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_SIZE_INVALID - The combination of the
    transfer size and the specified flag is invalid.

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_ENDPOINT_NOT_CONFIGURED - Endpoint is not enabled
    because device is not configured.

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_PARAMETER_INVALID - Device Layer handle is not
    valid.

  Summary:
    Reads data received from host on the requested endpoint.

  Description:
    This function requests a endpoint data read from the USB Device Layer. The
    function places a requests with driver, the request will get serviced as
    data is made available by the USB Host. A handle to the request is returned
    in the transferHandle parameter. The termination of the request is indicated
    by the USB_DEVICE_EVENT_ENDPOINT_READ_COMPLETE event. The amount of data
    read and the transfer handle associated with the request is returned along
    with the event in the pData parameter of the event handler. The transfer
    handle expires when event handler for the

    be accepted, the function returns an error code and transferHandle will
    contain the value USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

    If the size parameter is not a multiple of maxPacketSize or is 0, the
    function returns USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID in transferHandle and
    returns an error code as a return value. If the size parameter is a multiple
    of maxPacketSize and the host sends less than maxPacketSize data in any
    transaction, the transfer completes and the function driver will issue a
    USB_DEVICE_EVENT_ENDPOINT_READ_COMPLETE event along with the
    USB_DEVICE_EVENT_DATA_ENDPOINT_READ_COMPLETE_DATA data structure. If the
    size parameter is a multiple of maxPacketSize and the host sends
    maxPacketSize amount of data, and total data received does not exceed size,
    then the function driver will wait for the next packet. 
    
  Precondition:
    The device should have been configured.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle    - USB Device Layer Handle.

    transferHandle  - Pointer to a USB_DEVICE_TRANSFER_HANDLE type of
                      variable. This variable will contain the transfer handle
                      in case the read request was  successful.
    
    endpoint        - Endpoint from which the data should be read.
    
    data            - pointer to the data buffer where read data will be stored.
    
    size            - Size of the data buffer. Refer to the description section for more
                      details on how the size affects the transfer.

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_OK - The read request was successful. transferHandle
    contains a valid transfer handle.
    
    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_QUEUE_FULL - internal request queue 
    is full. The write request could not be added.

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_SIZE_INVALID - The specified transfer
    size was not a multiple of endpoint size or is 0.

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_ENDPOINT_NOT_CONFIGURED - The specified

  Summary:
    Enables a device endpoint.

  Description:
    This function enables a device endpoint for the specified transfer type and
    size. A Vendor specific device application may typically call this function
    in response to a Set Interface request from the host. Note that Device Layer
    will enable endpoints contained in Alternate Setting 0 of an interface, when
    the host configures the device. If there is only one alternate setting in an
    interface, the application may not need to call the
    USB_DEVICE_EndpointEnable function. 

    If the device supports multiple alternate settings in an Interface, the
    device application must then disable an endpoint (if it was enabled) before
    re-enabling it with the new settings.The application can use the
    USB_DEVICE_EndpointIsEnabled function to check the status of the endpoint and
    USB_DEVICE_EndpointDisable function to disable the endpoint. 
    
  Precondition:
    The device should have been configured.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle    - USB Device Layer Handle.

    interface          - This parameter is ignored in the PIC32 USB Device Stack 
                         implementation. 

    endpoint           - Endpoint to enable.
    
    transferType       - Type of transfer that this is endpoint will support. This 
                         should match the type reported to the host
    
    size               - Maximum endpoint size. This should match the value reported 
                         to the host.
  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_OK - The endpoint was enabled successfully.

    USB_DEVICE_RESULT_ERROR_ENDPOINT_INVALID - The specified instance
    was not provisioned in the application and is invalid.

  Example:
