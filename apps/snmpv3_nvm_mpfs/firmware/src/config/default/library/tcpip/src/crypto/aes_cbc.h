 v1.0	Original release - released with AN1044
 v2.0    Updated to support 192-bit and 256-bit modes.  API change to be
         compatible with PIC32 implementation.  This increases RAM usage but
         decreases the decode time.

  Summary:
    Encrypts a specified amount of data using cipher feedback (CFB) mode.
  Description:
    Encrypts a specified amount of data using cipher feedback (CFB) mode.
  Conditions:
      * Round keys must be create by AESCreateRoundKeys() before calling
        this routine.
      * p_cbc_state_data->intial_vector must be populated with the initialization
        vector before the first call of this function on a new data stream.
      * p_cbc_state_data->round_keys must be set to point to a buffer
        containing the round keys for this session.  This buffer must
        maintain the round keys until this session is complete.  The round
        keys can be created using the AESCreateRoundKeys() function.
  Input:
    cipher_text      - [out] pointer to the buffer where the encrypted data
                       should reside. This buffer must be a multiple of 16 bytes
                       even if the plain text passed in is not.  This buffer should
                       also always be larger than the plain_text buffer.
    num_cipher_bytes - [out] the number of bytes written to the cipher_text buffer.
                       Note that this could be more or less than the num_plain bytes due
                       to buffered data or padding.
    plain_text       - [in] pointer to the data that needs to be encrypted.
    num_plain_bytes  - [in] the number of bytes in the plain_text buffer
    round_keys       - [in] pointer to the round key buffer that will be used
                            for this encryption cycle.
    p_cbc_state_data - [in] pointer to an instance of the AES_CBC_STATE_DATA for this
                       stream. The first call of this function should have the
                       p_cbc_state_data->initial_vector set to the initialization
                       vector.  The same AES_CBC_STATE_DATA object should be used for
                       every call in the same data stream.  The contents of the
                       AES_CBC_STATE_DATA object shouldn't be changed by the user 
                       once an encryption stream has been started.
    options          - [in] Set of options that are ORed together (e.g. \-
                       AES_PAD_NONE | AES_STREAM_START). Valid options are\:
                       * AES_PAD_NONE
                       * AES_PAD_NULLS
                       * AES_PAD_8000
                       * AES_PAD_NUMBER
                       * AES_STREAM_START
                       * AES_STREAM_CONTINUE
                       * AES_STREAM_COMPLETE
                       * AES_CIPHER_TEXT_POINTER_ALIGNED
                       * AES_PLAIN_TEXT_POINTER_ALIGNED
