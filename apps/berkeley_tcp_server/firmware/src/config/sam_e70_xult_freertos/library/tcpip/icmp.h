  Summary:
    The Internet Control Message Protocol is used to send error and status messages
    and requests.

  Description:
    The Internet Control Message Protocol is used to send error and status messages 
    and requests. The ICMP module implements the Echo Reply message type (commonly 
    referred to as a ping) which can be used to determine if a specified host is 
    reachable across an IP network from a device running the TCP/IP stack. An ICMP 
    server is also supported to respond to pings from other devices.

/* Function:
    ICMP_ECHO_RESULT TCPIP_ICMP_EchoRequest (TCPIP_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST* pEchoRequest, TCPIP_ICMP_REQUEST_HANDLE* pHandle);

  Summary:
    Sends an ICMP echo request containing user supplied data


  Description:
    This function allows a stack client to send an ICMP query message to a remote host.
    The supplied sequence number and identifier will be used in the query message.
    The request will also contain user supplied data.
    The request is scheduled and the user will be notified of the outcome of the query
    using the callback function that's specified in the call.

  Precondition:
    The TCP/IP Stack must be initialized and up and running.


  Parameters:
    - pEchoRequest  - pointer to a TCPIP_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST data structure describing the request:
                        - netH           - The handle of the network interface to use for the request. Can be 0 if 
                                           a default interface is to be selected 
                        - targetAddr     - The IP address of the remote Host
                        - sequenceNumber - A sequence number to be used in the request
                        - identifier     - An identifier to be used in the request
                        - pData          - data buffer in the request
                        - dataSize       - number of bytes in the data buffer
                        - callback       - callback function to be called when a reply is received
    - pHandle       - address to store a handle to this ICMP request.
                      It will contain a valid handle/pointer if the call succeeded,
                      0 otherwise.
                      It can be used to cancel the request (if the user timeout
                      is < than the ICMP timeout: TCPIP_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT)
                      Could be NULL if not needed.    

  Returns:
    - ICMP_ECHO_OK     - Indicates the query request was successfully sent
    - ICMP_ECHO_RESULT - The query request was unsuccessfully sent, which results in an error code
                         (interface not ready for transmission, allocation error, etc.)

  Example:
  <code>
    uint8_t  myDataBuffer[200];     // buffer for the ping data
    void EchoCallback(TCPIP_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST* pReqData, TCPIP_ICMP_REQUEST_HANDLE icmpHandle, TCPIP_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST_RESULT result);    // callback function to be called

    TCPIP_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST myEchoRequest;
    myEchoRequest.netH  = 0;
    myEchoRequest.targetAddr  = 0xc0a00101;
    myEchoRequest.sequenceNumber = 1;
    myEchoRequest.identifier     = 0x1234;
    myEchoRequest.pData          = myDataBuffer;
    myEchoRequest.dataSize       = sizeof(myDataBuffer);
    myEchoRequest.callback       = EchoCallback;


    if(TCPIP_ICMP_EchoRequest(&myEchoRequest, 0) == ICMP_ECHO_OK )
    {
        // successfully sent the ICMP request
        //
        // EchoCallback() will be called and data can be examined
    }
    else
    {
        // process the error
    }
  </code>

  Remarks:
    The data buffer that's passed as part of the callback routine is no longer available 
    after the callback routine returns control.

    This routine is more generic than TCPIP_ICMP_EchoRequestSend and is preferred. 

    The user has to enforce the fact that the "identifier" field has 
    to be unique per (destination address, source address) pair.

    Currently there could be only one ping/echo request active at a time.
    If another echo request is active, a ICMP_ECHO_BUSY code will be returned. 


    Once the callback notification occurs, the echo request is completed
    and the icmpHandle is invalidated.

  Summary:
    Sends an ICMP echo request to a remote node.

  Description:
    This function allows a stack client to send an ICMP query message to a remote host.
    The supplied sequence number and identifier will be used in the query message.
    The user will be notified by the result of the query using a notification handle
    registered by using the TCPIP_ICMP_CallbackRegister function.

  Precondition:
    The TCP/IP Stack must be initialized and up and running.


  Parameters:
    - netH           - The handle of the network interface to use for the request. Can be 0 if 
	                   a default interface is to be selected

  Summary:

  Description:
    Allows a stack client to be notified of the receiving of a response from an ICMP query.
    Once an Echo request reply is received, the notification handler callback will be called,
    letting the client know of the result of the query.
    The callback will contain as parameters:
        - the network interface handle on which the query reply was received
        - the remote host IP address
        - a 32-bit value containing the sequence number in the low 16-bit part
          and the identifier value in the high 16-bit part.

  Precondition:
    The TCP/IP Stack must be initialized and up and running.

  Parameters:
    callback    - notification function to be registered.
                  This function will be called when an echo request reply is received.

  Returns:
    - A non-null handle if the registration succeeded
