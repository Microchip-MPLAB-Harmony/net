  Description:
    This function schedules a control transfer. pipeHandle contains a handle to
    a control pipe obtained through the USB_HOST_DeviceControlPipeOpen() function.
    setupPacket points to the setup command to be sent in the Setup Stage of the
    control transfer. The size and the direction of the data stage is indicated
    by the setup packet. In case of control transfers where there is no data
    stage, data is ignored and can be NULL. In all other cases, data should point
    to the data to data be transferred in the data stage of the control
    transfer. 
    
    If the transfer was scheduled successfully, transferHandle will contain a
    transfer handle that uniquely identifies this transfer. If the transfer
    could not be scheduled successfully, transferHandle will contain
    USB_HOST_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

    When the control transfer completes, the host layer will call the specified
    callback function. The context parameter specified here will be returned in
    the callback.

  Precondition:
    pipeHandle should be valid and should have been obtained through the
    USB_HOST_DeviceControlPipeOpen() function.

  Parameters:
    pipeHandle - Handle to a pipe opened using the
    USB_HOST_DeviceControlPipeOpen() function.

    transferHandle - output parameter that will contain the handle to this
    transfer.

    setupPacket - Pointer to the setup packet to sent to the device in the setup
    stage of the control transfer.

    data -  For control transfer with a data stage, this should point to data to
    be sent to the device (for a control write transfer) or point to the buffer
    that will receive data from the device (for a control read transfer). For
    control transfers that do not require a data stage, this parameter is
    ignored and can be NULL.

    callback - pointer to the callback function that will be called when the
    control transfer completes. If the callback function is NULL, there will be
    no notification of when the control transfer will complete.

    context - user defined context that is returned with the callback function.

  Returns:
    USB_HOST_RESULT_SUCCESS - the transfer was scheduled successfully.
    transferHandle will contain a valid transfer handle.
    USB_HOST_RESULT_FAILURE - an unknown failure occurred. transferHandle will
    contain USB_HOST_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.
    USB_HOST_RESULT_PIPE_HANDLE_INVALID - The pipe handle is not valid.
    USB_HOST_RESULT_PARAMETER_INVALID - The data pointer or transferHandle pointer

  Summary:
    Queries the configuration for the specified endpoint type and returns a

  Description:
    This function queries the specified configuration for the specified endpoint
    type and returns a pointer to the endpoint descriptor if found. The return
    pointer will point to the standard endpoint descriptor and class specific
    endpoint descriptors for that endpoint. The search criteria can specified by
    using the flags. 
    
    In a case where there are multiple endpoints in the interface, the function
    can be called repetitively to continue the search till the end of the
    interface descriptor is reached or till the search fails.  The query object
    maintains the last point where the search was successful and continues the
    search from that point onwards. Resetting the query object (through the
    USB_HOST_DeviceEndpointQueryClear) function will reset the search object and
    cause the search to start from the top of the interface descriptor.
   
  Precondition:
    The host layer should have been initialized and the bus should have been
    enabled.

  Parameters:
    interface - pointer to the interface descriptor to be searched.         

    query - pointer to the query object that defines the search type.

  Returns:
    If the endpoint descriptor was not found or if the search has reached the end
    of the interface descriptor, the function returns NULL. If the endpoint
    descriptor was found, the size will contain the size of the endpoint
    descriptor (including the class specific endpoint descriptors) and the

    );

  Summary:
    Queries the active configuration for the specified interface.

  Description:
    This function queries the active configuration for the specified interface
    and returns a pointer to the interface descriptor if found. The return
    pointer will point to the standard interface descriptor and class specific
    interface descriptors for that interface. The search criteria can specified
    by using the flags. 
    
    In a case where the interface has more than one alternate settings, the
    function can be called repetitively to continue the search till the end of the
    configuration descriptor is reached or till the search fails. The query flag
    in such should be set to ignore the alternate setting field.  The query
    object maintains the last point where the search was successful and
    continues the search from that point onwards. Resetting the query object
    (through the USB_HOST_QueryClear) function will reset the search object and
    cause the search to start from the top of the configuration descriptor.
   
  Precondition:
    The host layer should have been initialized and the bus should have been
    enabled.

  Parameters:
    configuration - pointer to the configuration descriptor to be queried.

    query - pointer to the query object that defines this search.
  
  Returns:
    If the interface descriptor was not found or if the search has reached the
    end of the configuration descriptor, the function returns NULL. If the
    interface descriptor was found, interface descriptor (including the class
    specific interface descriptors) and the function will return the pointer to
    the interface descriptor.
