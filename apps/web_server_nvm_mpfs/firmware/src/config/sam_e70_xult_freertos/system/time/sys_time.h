  Summary
    Time system service library interface.

  Description
    This file defines the interface to the Time system service library.  This
    library provides a free-running shared software timer/counter, (32--bit)
    giving the entire system a common time base and providing real-time
    capabilities such as delays and callbacks.  It also (optionally) provides
    the ability to create individual software timers (32--bit), under control
    of the client, with counter and callback capabilities.

  Remarks:
    This interface will be extended in the future to utilize Real Time Clock
    and Calendar (RTCC) support to provide time of day and date capabilities.

   Description:
    This data type defines a pointer to a time service callback function, thus

    the SYS_TIME_Callback shortcut functions.

   Precondition:
    The time service must have been initialized using the SYS_TIME_Initialize
    function before attempting to register a SYS Time callback function.

   Parameters:
    context    - A context value, returned untouched to the client when the
                 callback occurs.  It can be used to identify the instance of
                 the client who registered the callback.

   Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    //"MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT" is a user defined data structure with "isTimerExpired" as
    //one of the structure members.

   Summary:
    Creates and initializes a new 32-bit software timer instance.

   Description:
    This function creates/allocates a new instance of a 32-bit software timer.

    A software timer provides a counter that is separate from other timer
    counters and is under control of the caller. The counter can be started
    and stopped under caller control and its counter value and period value
    can be changed while the counter is either running or stopped.

   Precondition:
    The SYS_TIME_Initialize function should have been called before calling this
    function.

   Parameters:
    count      - The initial value of the counter, after the timer has been
                 created and before it has been started.

    period     - The counter interval at which the timer indicates time has
                 elapsed.

    callback   - Pointer to function that will be called every time the
                 period counts have elapsed.  (Actual timing will depend on
                 system performance and the base frequency at which the time
                 service is configured).

                 For single shot timers, the callback cannot be NULL.
                 For periodic timers, if the callback pointer is given as NULL,
                 no callback will occur, but SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired can
                 still be polled to determine if the period has expired for a
                 periodic shot timer.

    context    - A caller-defined value that's passed (unmodified) back to
                 the client as a parameter of callback function.  It can be
                 used to identify the client's context or passed with any
                 value.

    type        - Type of callback requested. If type is SYS_TIME_SINGLE, the
                  Callback function will be called once when the time period expires.
                  If type is SYS_TIME_PERIODIC Callback function will be called
                  repeatedly, every time the time period expires until the timer
                  object is stopped or deleted.

   Returns:
    An opaque value used to identify software timer instance if the call
    succeeds in allocating/creating the software timer. If the call fails
    SYS_TIME_HANDLE_INVALID is returned.

  Example:
    Given an implementation of the following function prototype:
    <code>
    void MyCallback ( uintptr_t context);
    </code>
    The following example creates a software timer instance.
    <code>
    SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle;
    //myData is the user-defined data that will be passed back in the registered callback function.
    handle = SYS_TIME_TimerCreate(0, SYS_TIME_MSToCount(200), &MyCallback, (uintptr_t)&myData, SYS_TIME_SINGLE);
    if (handle != SYS_TIME_HANDLE_INVALID)

   Precondition:
    The SYS_TIME_Initialize must have been called and a valid handle to the software
    timer to be reloaded must be available.

   Parameters:
    handle     - Handle to a software timer instance.

    period     - The new period value.

    callback   - The new callback function pointer.
                 For single shot timers, the callback must be specified.
                 For periodic timers, if the callback pointer is given as NULL,
                 no callback will occur, but SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired can
                 still be polled to determine if the period has expired for a
                 periodic timer.

    context    - The new caller-defined value that's passed (unmodified) back to
                 the client as a parameter of callback function.

    type        - Type of callback requested. If type is SYS_TIME_SINGLE, the
                  Callback function will be called once when the time period expires.
                  If type is SYS_TIME_PERIODIC Callback function will be called
                  repeatedly, every time the time period expires until the timer

   Returns:
      SYS_TIME_SUCCESS - If the call succeeded.

      SYS_TIME_ERROR   - If the call failed (and the timer was not modified).

  Example:
    Given an implementation of the following function prototype:
    <code>
    void MyNewCallback ( uintptr_t context);
    </code>
    The following example updates a software timer instance.

   Description:
       This function reports whether or not the current period of the given
       software timer has expired and clears the internal flag tracking period
       expiration so that each period expiration will only be reported once.

   Precondition:
       The SYS_TIME_Initialize and SYS_TIME_TimerCreate or SYS_TIME_CallbackRegisterMS/
       SYS_TIME_CallbackRegisterUS functions (with callback type set to
       SYS_TIME_PERIODIC) must have been called before calling this function.

   Parameters:
       handle   - Handle to a software timer instance

   Returns:
       true     - If the period has expired.

       false    - If the period is not expired.

  Example:
       <code>
       if (SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired(timer) == true)
       {
           // Timer has expired. Take desired action.
       }
       </code>

  Remarks:
       1.  For a periodic timer, a call to SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired
           returns true after the first time period has expired. After calling
           this function, the expiry flag is internally cleared and is set again
           once the ongoing period of the periodic timer expires.

       2.  Unlike the SYS_TIME_DelayIsComplete routine the
           SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired does not delete the timer, it just returns
           the status of the timer.

       3.  To poll the status of the delay timers, SYS_TIME_DelayIsComplete must
           be used instead of the SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired routine, as
           SYS_TIME_DelayIsComplete additionally deletes the delay timer object
           once the delay has expired.

       4.  Since single shot timers does not support polling (registration of a callback
           is mandatory for single shot timers), the SYS_TIME_CallbackRegisterMS
           routine must not be used to poll the status of the single shot timers.
