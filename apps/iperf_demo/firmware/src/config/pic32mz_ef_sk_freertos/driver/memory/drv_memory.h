  Summary:
    Handle to identify commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read, Write, Erase or
    EraseWrite functions. This handle allows the application to track the
    completion of the operation. This command handle is also returned to the
    client along with the event that has occurred with respect to the command.
    This allows the application to connect the event to a specific command in
    case where multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

  Remarks:
    Refer sys_media.h for definition of SYS_MEDIA_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE.

   Summary
    Pointer to a Memory Driver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the Memory event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to
    receive event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write/Erase/EraseWrite
                      requests

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>

    void appTransferHandler
    (
        DRV_MEMORY_EVENT event,
        DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_MEMORY_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:
                xfer_done = true;
                break;
            case DRV_MEMORY_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
                // Handle Error
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }

    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_MEMORY_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    requested operation was completed successfully.

    If the event is DRV_MEMORY_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.

    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was registered using the
    DRV_MEMORY_TransferHandlerSet function. This context handle value is passed
    back to the client as the "context" parameter. It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

    Used in Asynchronous mode of operation.

    Refer sys_media.h for definition of SYS_MEDIA_EVENT_HANDLER.

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified Memory driver instance and provides a handle.

    When Open is called for the first time for specified Memory driver instance it
    opens the attached media device and reads the geomerty details.

    This handle returned must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver.

  Preconditions:
    Function DRV_MEMORY_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex   -  Identifier for the instance to be opened

    ioIntent   -  Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                  DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                  of the driver

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, DRV_HANDLE_INVALID is returned. Errors can occur
    under the following circumstances:
        - if the attached media device is not ready or the geometry get fails.
        - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_MEMORY_CLIENTS_NUMBER
          is insufficient
        - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
          exclusively by another client
        - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
          been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
        - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is
          invalid
        - if the attached memory device open or geometry read fails for first time.

  Example:

    If the requesting client has not registered any transfer handler callback
    with the driver, he can call DRV_MEMORY_CommandStatusGet() API to know
    the current status of the request.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_MEMORY_Open() must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as a parameter to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the
                    driver's open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer

  Summary:
    Erase and Write blocks of data in the sectors where the block start belongs.

  Description:
    This function combines the step of erasing a sector and then writing the
    page. The application can use this function if it wants to avoid having to
    explicitly delete a sector in order to update the pages contained in the
    sector.

    This function schedules a non-blocking operation to erase and write blocks
    of data into attached device memory.

    The function returns with a valid command handle in the commandHandle argument
    if the write request was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request
    to the hardware instance queue and returns immediately.

    While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver
    and should not be modified.

    The function returns DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle
    argument under the following circumstances:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the sourceBuffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the number of blocks to be written is either zero or more than the
      number of blocks actually available
    - if the driver handle is invalid

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_MEMORY_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully or DRV_MEMORY_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if the
    buffer was not processed successfully.

    If the requesting client has not registered any transfer handler callback
    with the driver, he can call DRV_MEMORY_CommandStatusGet() API to know
    the current status of the request.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MEMORY_Open() must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as a parameter to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return command
                    handle. If NULL, then command handle is not returned.

    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed into media
                    device memory

    blockStart    - Write block start where the write should begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be written.

  Returns:
    The command handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It Will be
    DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not queued.

  Example:
    <code>

    #define BUFFER_SIZE    4096
    uint8_t buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    // Use DRV_MEMORY_GeometryGet () to find the write region geometry.
    uint32_t blockStart = 0x0;

  Summary:
    Gets the current status of the transfer request on attached device.

  Description:
    This routine gets the current status of the transfer request. The application
    must use this routine where the status of a scheduled request needs to be
    polled on.

    The application can alternatively register a transfer handler to receive the
    transfer completion events.

  Preconditions:
    DRV_MEMORY_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

  Returns:
    MEMORY_DEVICE_TRANSFER_ERROR_UNKNOWN
        - If the handle is invalid
        - If the status read request fails

    MEMORY_DEVICE_TRANSFER_BUSY
        - If the current transfer request is still being processed

    MEMORY_DEVICE_TRANSFER_COMPLETED
        - If the transfer request is completed

  Example:
    <code>

    // memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.

    if (MEMORY_DEVICE_TRANSFER_COMPLETED == DRV_MEMORY_TransferStatusGet(memoryHandle))
    {

  Summary:
    Gets the current status of the command.

  Description:
    This routine gets the current status of the buffer. The application must use
    this routine where the status of a scheduled buffer needs to polled on.

    The function may return DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in a case where the
    buffer handle has expired. A buffer handle expires when the internal buffer object
    is re-assigned to another erase or write request. It is recommended that this
    function be called regularly in order to track the buffer status correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive write
    or erase operation completion events.

  Preconditions:
    DRV_MEMORY_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the command handle

  Returns:
    DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_COMPLETED
        - If the transfer request is completed

    DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_QUEUED
        - If the command is Queued and waiting to be processed.

    DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_IN_PROGRESS
    - If the current transfer request is still being processed

    DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_ERROR_UNKNOWN
        - If the handle is invalid
        - If the status read request fails

  Example:
    <code>

     // memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.
     // commandHandle is the handle returned by any read/write/erase block operation.

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when queued operation has completed.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to set an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.

    When a client calls a read, write, erase or a erasewrite function, it is
    provided with a handle identifying the command that was added to the driver's
    buffer queue. The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling
    "transferHandler" function when the queued operation has completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any operations
    that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists until the
    client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which could be a
    "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MEMORY_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    transferHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the
                   user

    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the transferHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle;

    // memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.
    // Client registers an event handler with driver

    // Event is received when the erase request is completed.

        DRV_MEMORY_EVENT event,
        DRV_MEMORY_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,

  Remarks:
    If the client does not want to be notified when the queued operation has
    completed, it does not need to register a callback.
