  Summary
    Time system service library interface.

  Description
    This file defines the interface to the Time system service library.  This
    library provides a free-running shared software timer/counter, (32--bit)
    giving the entire system a common time base and providing real-time
    capabilities such as delays and callbacks.  It also (optionally) provides
    the ability to create individual software timers (32--bit), under control
    of the client, with counter and callback capabilities.

  Remarks:
    This interface will be extended in the future to utilize Real Time Clock
    and Calendar (RTCC) support to provide time of day and date capabilities.

/* Function:

   Summary:
       This function is used to generate a delay of a given number of
       microseconds.

   Description:
       This function creates a single shot timer that will be deleted
       automatically once the specified delay has completed.  If used in an RTOS
       configuration the function will block until the requested delay has
       expired.  In a non-blocking (bare-metal) configuration, the function will
       return immediately, requiring the caller to use the handle provided to
       check the delay timer's status.

   Precondition:
       The SYS_TIME_Initialize function must have been called before calling
       this function.

   Parameters:
       us     - The desired number of microseconds to delay.

       handle  - Address of the variable to receive the timer handle value.
                If the call fails or completes before returning, the handle
                variable will be ignored (and may be passed as NULL in an
                RTOS environment).

   Returns:
      SYS_TIME_SUCCESS - If the call succeeded.

      SYS_TIME_ERROR   - If the call failed.

   Example:
       <code>
       SYS_TIME_HANDLE timer = SYS_TIME_HANDLE_INVALID;

       if (SYS_TIME_SUCCESS != SYS_TIME_DelayUS(50, &timer))
       {
           // Handle error
       }
       </code>

   Remarks:
       Will delay at least the requested number of microseconds or longer
       depending on system performance.

       Delay values of 0 or less will return SYS_TIME_ERROR.

       Will return SYS_TIME_ERROR if timer handle pointer is NULL in a
       non-blocking environment.

       this function.

   Parameters:
       ms     - The desired number of milliseconds to delay.

       handle  - Address of the variable to receive the timer handle value.
                If the call fails or completes before returning, the handle
                variable will be ignored (and may be passed as NULL in an

   Returns:
      SYS_TIME_SUCCESS - If the call succeeded.

   Summary:
      Converts a 32-bit counter value to time interval in microseconds.

   Description:
      This function converts a 32-bit counter value to time interval in
      microseconds, based on the common system timer counter frequency
      as configured and as reported by SYS_TIME_FrequencyGet.

   Precondition:
      The SYS_TIME_Initialize function should have been called before calling
      this function.

   Parameters:
      count  - Counter value to be converted to an equivalent value in
               microseconds.

   Returns:
      Number of microseconds represented by the given counter value.

   Example:
      Given a previously captured uint32_t counter value called "timestamp"
      captured using the SYS_TIME_CounterGet function, the following example
      will calculate the number of microseconds elapsed since timestamp was
      captured.
      <code>
      uint32_t count = SYS_TIME_CounterGet() - timestamp;
      uint32_t us    = SYS_TIME_CountToUS(count);
      </code>

  Remarks:
      Since unsigned arithmetic is used, interval subtractions of earlier
      counter values from later counter values will produce correct results
      even if counter roll-over occurs in between as long as unsigned counts
      of the same number of bits are used (i.e. 32-bits as returned by
      SYS_TIME_CounterGet).

      Only intervals of less than 2^32 - 1 counts can be measured using a
      32-bit counter as the library does not track and cannot represent multiple
      roll-overs of counter in 32-bits.  To count larger intervals, the system
      must be configured to use a larger counter.

                        SYS_TIME_CALLBACK_TYPE type )

   Summary:
    Creates and initializes a new 32-bit software timer instance.

   Description:
    This function creates/allocates a new instance of a 32-bit software timer.

    A software timer provides a counter that is seperate from other timer
    counters and is under control of the caller.  The counter created increments
    at the same frequency as the common system counter (as reported by
    SYS_TIME_FrequencyGet).  The counter can be started and stopped under caller
    control and its counter value and period value can be changed while the
    counter is either running or stopped.

    The period value can be used to identify time intervals either by polling
    to identify when the period has expired or by using a callback mechanism.

   Precondition:
    The SYS_TIME_Initialize function should have been called before calling this
    function.

   Parameters:
    count      - The initial value of the counter, after the timer has been
                 created and before it has been started.

    period     - The counter interval at which the timer indicates time has
                 elapsed.

    callback   - Pointer to function that will be called every time at least
                 period counts have elapsed.  (Actual timing will depend on
                 system performance and the base frequency at which the time
                 service is configured.

                 If the callback pointer is given as NULL, no callback will
                 occur, but SYS_TIME_TimerPeriodHasExpired can still be polled
                 to determine if the period has expired.

    context    - A caller-defined value that's passed (unmodified) back to
                 the client as a parameter of callback function.  It can be
                 used to identify the client's context or passed with any
                 value.

    type        - Type of callback requested.

                  SYS_TIME_SINGLE   - Callback function will be called once when the
                                      delay period expires.

                  SYS_TIME_PERIODIC - Callback function will be called repeatedly,
                                      every time the delay period expires until the
                                      timer object is stopped or deleted.

   Returns:
    An opaque value used to identify software timer instance if the call
    succeeds in allocating/creating the software timer.  If the call fails
    SYS_TIME_HANDLE_INVALID is returned.

  Example:
    Given an implemention of the following function prototype:
    <code>
    void MyCallback ( uintptr_t context);
    </code>
    The following example creates a software timer instance.
    <code>
    SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle = SYS_TIME_TimerCreate(0ul, 2000ul, &MyCallback, &myData);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Software timers count at the same frequency as the common system timer
    (as reported by SYS_TIME_FrequencyGet) and the same count/time conversion
    routines can be used to calculate interval times.

                                      timer object is stopped or deleted.

   Returns:
      SYS_TIME_SUCCESS - If the call succeeded.

      SYS_TIME_ERROR   - If the call failed (and the timer was not modified).

  Example:
    Given an implemention of the following function prototype:

    The following example updates a software timer instance.
