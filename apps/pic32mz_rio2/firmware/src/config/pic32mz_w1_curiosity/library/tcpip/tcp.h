/* TCP packet handler Pointer

  Function:
    bool <FunctionName> (TCPIP_NET_HANDLE hNet, struct _tag_TCPIP_MAC_PACKET* rxPkt, const void* hParam);

  Summary:
    Pointer to a function(handler) that will get called to process an incoming TCP packet.

  Description:
    Pointer to a function that will be called by the TCP module
    when a RX packet is available.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    hNet        - network handle on which the packet has arrived
    rxPkt       - pointer to incoming packet
    hParam      - user passed parameter when handler was registered

  Returns:
    true - if the packet is processed by the external handler.
           In this case the TCP module will no longer process the packet
    false - the packet needs to be processed internally by the TCP as usual           

  Remarks:
    The packet handler is called in the TCP context.
    The handler should be kept as short as possible as it affects the processing of all the other
    TCP RX traffic.

    Before calling the external packet handler:
    - the rxPkt->pktFlags has the bit 9 (value 0x0200) set for an IPv6 packet, cleared for IPv4
    - the rxPkt->pTransportLayer points to an TCP_HEADER data structure.
    - the rxPkt->pNetLayer points to an IPV4_HEADER/IPV6_HEADER data structure.
    - the rxPkt->pktIf points to the interface receiving the packet
    - the first data segment segLen is adjusted to store the size of the TCP data 

    Important!
    When the packet handler returns true, once it's done processing the packet,
    it needs to acknowledge it, i.e. return to the owner,
    which is the MAC driver serving the network interface!
    This means that the packet acknowledge function needs to be called,
    with a proper acknowledge parameter and the QUEUED flag needs to be cleared, if needed:
    if((*rxPkt->ackFunc)(rxPkt, rxPkt->ackParam))
    {
           rxPkt->pktFlags &= ~TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED;
    }
    Failure to do that will result in memory leaks and starvation of the MAC driver.
    See the tcpip_mac.h for details.

  Summary:
    Opens a TCP socket as a server.

  Description:
    Provides a unified method for opening TCP server sockets.

    Sockets are created at the TCP module initialization, and can be claimed with this
    function and freed using TCPIP_TCP_Close.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
    IP_ADDRESS_TYPE addType         -   The type of address being used. Example: IP_ADDRESS_TYPE_IPV4.
    TCP_PORT localPort              -   TCP port to listen on for connections.
    IP_MULTI_ADDRESS* localAddress  -   Local address to use.
                                        Use 0 if listening on any network interface.

  Description:
    Provides a unified method for opening TCP client sockets.

    Sockets are created at the TCP module initialization, and can be claimed with this

  Summary:
    Binds a socket to a local address.

  Description:
    This function is meant for unconnected server and client sockets.
    It is similar to TCPIP_TCP_SocketNetSet that assigns a specific source interface for a socket.
    If localPort is 0 the stack will assign a unique local port. Sockets don't need specific binding, 
	it is done automatically by the stack.
    However, specific binding can be requested using these functions.
    Works for both client and server sockets.

  Precondition:
    TCP socket should have been opened with TCPIP_TCP_ServerOpen()/TCPIP_TCP_ClientOpen().
    hTCP - valid socket

  Parameters:
    hTCP            -   Socket to bind
    addType         -   The type of address being used. Example: IP_ADDRESS_TYPE_IPV4/IP_ADDRESS_TYPE_IPV6.
    localPort       -   Local port to use
                        If 0,  the stack will assign a unique local port 
    localAddress    -   The local address to bind to.
                        Could be NULL if the local address does not need to be changed

  Returns:

  Summary:
    Binds a socket to a remote address.

  Description:
    This function is meant for unconnected server and client sockets.
	Sockets don't need specific remote binding, they should accept connections on any incoming interface.
    Thus the binding is done automatically by the stack.
    However, specific remote binding can be requested using these functions.
    For a server socket it can be used to restrict accepting connections from  a specific remote host.
    For a client socket it will just change the default binding done when the socket was opened.

  Precondition:
    TCP socket should have been opened with TCPIP_TCP_ServerOpen()/TCPIP_TCP_ClientOpen().
    hTCP - valid socket

  Parameters:
    hTCP            -   Socket to bind
    addType         -   The type of address being used. Example: IP_ADDRESS_TYPE_IPV4/IP_ADDRESS_TYPE_IPV6.
    remotePort      -   remote port to use
                        Could be 0 if the remote port does not need to be changed
    remoteAddress   -   The remote address to bind to.
                        Could be NULL if the remote address does not need to be changed

  Returns:
    - true  - Indicates success
    - false - Indicates failure


  Remarks:
    The socket remote port is changed only if a non-zero remotePort value is passed.

    The socket remote host address is changed only if a non-zero remoteAddress value is passed.

    The call will fail if the socket is already connected (both server and client sockets).

  Function:
    bool TCPIP_TCP_WasDisconnected(TCP_SOCKET hTCP)

  Summary:
    Function indicating that the socket was disconnected from the remode node.

  Description:
    This function indicates that the socket has received a FIN from the remote node.
    This signals that the remote node has finished transmitting its data.
    By default, the socket will be in the CLOSE_WAIT state.

    At this point it is up to the socket owner to send some more data or to close the socket.
    
    When done transmitting its data, the socket owner should call TCPIP_TCP_Disconnect() or TCPIP_TCP_Close().
    TCPIP_TCP_Disconnect works for both server and client sockets.
    The server socket will return to listen state.
    The client socket will be closed.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
    hTCP - The socket to check.

  Return Values:
    - true - The socket has received FIN
    - false - The socket has not received FIN
              or the socket is invalid

  Remarks:
    The obsolete symbol TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT != 0
    causes the socket to transition itself from CLOSE_WAIT state:
    - to listen state for a server socket
    - to close a client socket
    However this behavior is not according to the standards and could be dangerous
    especially in multi-threaded environments.

    The info that the FIN was received could be also obtained
    by registering a signal with the socket (the preferred way).

  Description:
    Writes an array from a buffer to a TCP socket.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
    hTCP - The socket to which data is to be written.
    data - Pointer to the array to be written.
    len  - Number of bytes to be written.

  Returns:
    The number of bytes written to the socket.  If less than len, the
    buffer became full or the socket is not connected.
	
  Remarks:
    This operation can cause a TCP packet to be transmitted over the
    network (i.e., a TCPIP_TCP_Flush operation to be performed) when there is
    data in the TCP TX buffer that can be sent and any of the following occurs:
    - There is no more space available in the TCP buffer.
    - The TCP_OPTION_THRES_FLUSH_ON is set and the TX buffer is at least half full
    - The amount of data that can be sent is bigger than the remote host MSS
      or than half of the maximum advertised window size.
    - The Nagle algorithm is disabled and there is no unacknowledged data. 

    If none of these occur and the socket user does not add data to the TX socket buffer,
    the TCP state machine will automatically flush the buffer when the TCP_AUTO_TRANSMIT_TIMEOUT_VAL
    time-out elapsed. 

    The default TCP_AUTO_TRANSMIT_TIMEOUT_VAL is 40 ms.

  Summary:
    Adjusts the relative sizes of the RX and TX buffers.

  Description:
    This function can be used to simultaneously adjust the sizes
    of the RX and TX FIFOs.

    Adjusting the size of the TX/RX FIFO on the fly can allow for optimal transmission speed
    for one-sided application protocols.
    For example, HTTP typically begins by receiving large amounts of data from the client,
    then switches to serving large amounts of data back.
    Adjusting the FIFO at these points can increase performance in systems that have
    limited resources.
    Once the FIFOs are adjusted, a window update is sent.

    Although the TX and RX socket buffers are completely independent, for the
    purpose of this function they can be considered together if
    neither TCP_ADJUST_TX_ONLY nor TCP_ADJUST_RX_ONLY flags are set.

    In these conditions the TCP_ADJUST_FLAGS control the distribution
    of the  available space between the TX and RX FIFOs.
    If neither or both of TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_TX and
    TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_RX are set, the function distributes the
    remaining space (if any) equally.
    If the new requested FIFOs space is greater that the old existing FIFOs space
    the TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_TX and TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_RX are ignored.

    TCP_ADJUST_PRESERVE_RX and TCP_ADJUST_PRESERVE_TX request the
    preserving of the existing data.
    Existing data can be preserved as long as the old data in the buffer
    does not exceed the capacity of the new buffer.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
    hTCP        - The socket to be adjusted
    wMinRXSize  - Minimum number of bytes for the RX FIFO
    wMinTXSize  - Minimum number of bytes for the TX FIFO
    vFlags      - If TCP_ADJUST_TX_ONLY or TCP_ADJUST_RX_ONLY  are not set,
                    the TX and RX buffers are evaluated together and any
                    combination of the following flags is valid:
                    TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_RX, TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_TX
                    TCP_ADJUST_PRESERVE_RX, TCP_ADJUST_PRESERVE_TX
					
                  If TCP_ADJUST_TX_ONLY or TCP_ADJUST_RX_ONLY is set
                    TX and RX buffers are treated individually
                    and TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_TX, TCP_ADJUST_GIVE_REST_TO_RX
                    values are irrelevant.
					
                 TCP_ADJUST_TX_ONLY and TCP_ADJUST_RX_ONLY both set is invalid.

  Return Values:
    - true  - The FIFOs were adjusted successfully
    - false - New RX and/or TX buffers could not be allocated
              and therefore the socket was left unchanged.

  Remarks:
    The function will automatically maintain minimal values for both TX and RX buffers.

    To avoid having a socket with no associated buffers, the function first
    allocates the new buffers and, if succeeded, it frees the old ones.

    The TX and RX FIFOs (buffers) associated with a socket
    are completely separate and independent.
    However, when TCP_ADJUST_TX_ONLY or TCP_ADJUST_RX_ONLY are not set,
    for the purpose of this function, the TX and RX FIFOs are considered
    to be contiguous so that the total FIFO space is divided between
    the TX and RX FIFOs.
    This provides backward compatibility with previous versions of this function.

    The new flags TCP_ADJUST_TX_ONLY and TCP_ADJUST_RX_ONLY allow changing
    the size of TX and RX buffers independently.
    This is the preferred option.

    TX or RX associated buffer sizes can be changed too using the socket options.
    See TCPIP_TCP_OptionsSet.

    The size of the buffers should NOT be decreased when the socket has pending data
    to be sent to the remote party or to be received by the socket user.
    Doing this may disrupt the communication, make the TCP algorithm fail or have an 
    unpredicted behavior!

  Description:

  Precondition:
    TCP valid socket.

  Parameters:
	s		    - The TCP socket
    sigMask      - mask of signals to be reported
    handler     - signal handler to be called when a TCP event occurs.
    hParam      - Parameter to be used in the handler call.
                  This is user supplied and is not used by the TCP module.

  Returns:
    Returns a valid handle if the call succeeds, or a null handle if
    the call failed (null handler, no such socket, existent handler).

  Remarks:

    Only one signal handler per socket is supported.
    A new handler does not override the existent one.
    Instead TCPIP_TCP_SignalHandlerDeregister has to be explicitly called.

    The handler has to be short and fast. It is meant for
    setting an event flag, not for lengthy processing!

    The hParam is passed by the client.

    For multi-threaded systems the TCP/IP packet dispatch does not occur on the user thread.
    The signal handler will be called on a different thread context.
    It is essential that this handler is non blocking and really fast.
    

    For multi-threaded systems, once set, it is not recommended to change the signal handler at run time.
    Synchronization between user threads and packet dispatch threads could be difficult.

  Description:
    This function returns the current status of the TCP module.
    If the TCP quiet time has elapsed (or it was not enabled when TCP was built)
    then the TCP module is ready for operation and TCP sockets can send and receive data.
    If the TCP quiet time is still in effect, then the TCP module is quiet and it

  Returns:
    true    - the quiet time has elapsed and the TCP module is ready to transmit data
    false   - the quiet time is still in effect and TCP module is silent

  Remarks:
    The TCP quiet time occurs at the stack start up and can be enabled/disabled
    using the TCP module configuration parameters.

  Summary:
    Sets a new packet processing handler.

  Description:
    This function registers a new packet processing handler.
    The caller can use the handler to be notified of incoming packets
    and given a chance to examine/process them.

  Precondition:
    TCP properly initialized

  Parameters:
    pktHandler      - the packet handler which will be called for an incoming packet
    handlerParam    - packet handler parameter

  Returns:
