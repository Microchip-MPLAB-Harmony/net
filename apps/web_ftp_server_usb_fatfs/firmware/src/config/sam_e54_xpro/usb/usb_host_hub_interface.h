/* USB Hub Port API Interface

  Summary:
    Group of function pointers to the USB Hub Port Functions.

  Description:
    This structure is a group of function pointers pointing to the USB Hub Port
    API routines. The USB Hub or USB root hub should export this group of
    functions so that the Host and device layer can access the port
    functionality.

  Remarks:
    None.
