  Summary:
    This function schedules a MSD BOT transfer.

  Description:
    This function schedules a MSD BOT transfer. The command to be executed is
    specified in the cdb. This should be pointer to a 16 byte command descriptor
    block. The actual length of the command is specified by cdbLength. If there
    is data to be transferred, the pointer to the buffer is specified by data.
    The size of the buffer is specified in size. When the transfer completes,
    the callback function will be called. The context will be returned in the
    callback function.

  Preconditions:
    None.

  Parameters:
    cdb - pointer to the command to be executted. Should be a pointer to a 16
    byte array. Unused bytes should be zero-padded.

    cdbLength - Actual size of the command.

    data - pointer to the data buffer if a data stage is involved.

    size - size of the data buffer.

    callback - callback function to called when the transfer has completed.

    transferDirection - specifies the direction of the MSD transfer.

    context - caller defined context that is returned in the callback function.

  Returns:
    USB_HOST_MSD_RESULT_FAILURE - An unknown failure occurred.
    USB_HOST_MSD_RESULT_BUSY - The transfer cannot be scheduled right now. The
    caller should retry.
    USB_HOST_MSD_RESULT_LUN_HANDLE_INVALID - This LUN does not exist in the
    system.
    USB_HOST_MSD_RESULT_SUCCESS - The transfer request was scheduled.

  Remarks:
    This is a local function and should not be called directly by the
    application.

  Summary:
    This function maintains the MSD transfer error handling state machine.

  Description:
    This function maintains the MSD transfer error handling state machine. This
    function should be called periodically after the USB_HOST_MSD_Transfer
    function has been called to schedule a transfer. The function should be
    called periodically atleast till the transfer completion event has been
    received. Calling this function while a BOT transfer is in progress allows
    the MSD Host Client driver to perform BOT error handling in a non-blocking
    manner.  

    Calling this function when there is no BOT transfer in progress will not
    have any effect. In case of BOT error handling, calling this function will
    eventually result in a BOT transfer event. It is not necessary to call this
    function after this event has occurred (till the next BOT transfer has been
    scheduled).

  Preconditions:
    The lunHandle should be valid.

  Parameters:
    lunHandle - handle to valid LUN.

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    While running in an RTOS application, this function should be called in the
    same thread that requested the BOT Transfer and operating the logical unit.
