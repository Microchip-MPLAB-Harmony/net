/* SCSI Driver Command Handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read, Write functions. This
    handle allows the application to track the completion of the operation. This
    command handle is also returned to the client along with the event that has
    occurred with respect to the command.  This allows the application to
    connect the event to a specific command in case where multiple commands are
    queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set. 

  Remarks:
    None.

/* SCSI Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a SCSI Driver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the NVM event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value 
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to 
    receive event calls back from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write/Erase requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MySCSIEventHandler
    (
        USB_HOST_SCSI_EVENT event,
        USB_HOST_SCSI_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case USB_HOST_SCSI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case USB_HOST_SCSI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is USB_HOST_SCSI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    write or a read operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is USB_HOST_SCSI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the
    scheduled operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided at
    the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    USB_HOST_SCSI_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is passed
    back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations within this function.

        uint32_t nBlock
    );

  Summary:
    Peforms a block write operation.

  Description:
    This function will perform a block write operation. The operation will not
    complete when the function returns. Instead a handle to the operation will
    be returned in commandHandle and driver will generate an event when the
    operation has completed. The command handle will be returned along with the
    event. The data to be written is specified by buffer. Data will be written
    to the blockStart block and nBlock buffers will be written.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    scsiHandle - handle to the driver to be closed.

    commandHandle - pointer to a variable where the command handle will be stored.

    buffer - Source buffer. The contents of this buffer should not be modified
    untill the write operation has completed (till the event has been
    generated).

    blockStart - block to which data should be written to.

    nBlock - number of blocks to written.

  Returns:
    A handle to the command is returned in commandHandle. This will be
    SYS_FS_MEDIA_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request failed.

  Example:
    <code>
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This function is typically called by the file system media manager.

  Description:
    This function will set an attach event handler. The attach event handler
    will be called when a MSD device has been attached. The context will be
    returned in the event handler. This function should be called before the bus
    has been enabled.
