Description:
    This type specifies the partitioning rule. When SYS_FS_FORMAT_FAT* format

    created and then an FAT volume is created on the partition. When SYS_FS_FORMAT_ANY
    format is specified FAT FS code decides on the format. When SYS_FS_FORMAT_SFD
    format is specified, the FAT volume starts from the first sector of the physical drive.

    The SYS_FS_FORMAT_FAT* partitioning is usually used for hard disk, MMC,
    SDC, CFC and U Disk. It can divide a physical drive into one or more
    partitions with a partition table on the MBR. However Windows does not
    support multiple partition on the removable media. The SYS_FS_FORMAT_SFD is
    non-partitioned method. The FAT volume starts from the first sector on the
    physical drive without partition table. It is usually used for floppy disk,
    micro drive, optical disk, and super-floppy media.

/* Function:
    SYS_FS_RESULT SYS_FS_Initialize
    (
        const void* initData
    );

    Summary:
      Initializes the file system abstraction layer (sys_fs layer).

    Description:
      This function initializes the abstraction layer (sys_fs layer) and sets
      up the necessary parameters.

    Precondition:
      This is the first function to be called during usage of sys_fs. Calling
      other functions of sys_fs without initializing the sys_fs will cause
      unpredictable behavior.

    Parameters:
      initData - Pointer to an array of type SYS_FS_REGISTRATION_TABLE. The
                 number of elements of array is decided by the definition
                 SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE. If the application uses one file
                 system (say only FAT FS), SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE is
                 defined to be 1.  Otherwise, if the application uses 2 file
                 systems (say FAT FS and MPFS2), SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE is
                 defined to be 2.

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - SYS FS Layer was initialized successfully.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - SYS FS Layer initialization failed. The reason for
                           the failure can be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error.

    Example:
      <code>
        // This code shows an example of how the SYS FS is initialized
        // Only one file system is used

        #define SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE            1

    (
        const char *devName, 
        const char *mountName,
        SYS_FS_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE filesystemtype, 
        unsigned long mountflags, 
        const void *data
    );

    Summary:
      Mounts the file system.

    Description:
      The mount command attaches the file system specified to a volume. The
      call to the mount should be non blocking in nature.  The application code
      has to allow the SYS_FS_Tasks to run periodically while calling the
      SYS_FS_Mount function. If the SYS_FS_Mount is called in a blocking mode,
      then the SYS_Tasks() never gets a chance to run and therefore, the media
      will not be analyzed and finally, the SYS_FS_Mount will never succeed.
      This will result in a deadlock.

      There is no mechanism available for the application to know if the
      specified volume (devName) is really attached or not. The only available
      possibility is to keep trying to mount the volume (with the devname),
      until success is achieved.
      
      It is prudent that the application code implements a time-out mechanism
      while trying to mount a volume (by calling SYS_FS_Mount). The trial for
      mount should continue at least 10 times before before assuming that the
      mount will never succeed. This has to be done for every new volume to be
      mounted.

      The standard names for volumes (devName) used in the MPLAB Harmony file
      system is as follows:
        NVM       - "nvm"    "media number" "volume number"
        SD card   - "mmcblk" "media number" "volume number"
        MSD       - "sd"     "media number" "volume number"

      Where, "media number" a, b, c... depends on the number of the type of
      connected media, and where, "volume number" 1, 2, 3... depends on the
      number of partitions in that media.

      The convention for assigning names to volumes is further described below
      with examples:

      If a SD card (with four partitions) is attached to the system, and
      assuming all four partitions are recognized, there will be four devNames:
      1. mmcblka1
      2. mmcblka2
      3. mmcblka3 and 
      4. mmcblka4

      Subsequently, if NVM media is attached that has only one partition, the
      devname will be: nvma1.

      Later, if another SD card is attached to the system that has one
      partition, the devname will be mmcblkb1.

      Finally, there will be six volume names (or devNames), which are
      available for the application to be mounted and used for the file system.

    Precondition:
      The "devName" name for the volume has to be known. The file system type
      with which each of the volumes are formatted has to be known. Trying to
      mount a volume with a file system which is different from what the volume
      is actually formatted, will cause mount failure.

    Parameters:
      devName        - The device name (name of volume) which needs to be
                       mounted. The devName has to be preceded by the string
                       "/dev/".
      mountName      - Mount name for the device to be mounted. This is a name
                       provided by the user. In future, while accessing the
                       mounted volume (say, during SYS_FS_FileOpen operation),
                       the mountName is used to refer the path for file. The
                       mount name has to be preceded by the string "/mnt/"
      filesystemtype - Native file system of SYS_FS_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE type.
      mountflags     - Mounting control flags. This parameter is reserved for
                       future enhancements. Therefore, always pass zero.
      data           - The data argument is interpreted by the different file
                       systems. This parameter is reserved for future
                       enhancements. Therefore, always pass NULL.

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - Mount was successful.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - Mount was unsuccessful. The reason for the failure
                           can be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error.

    Example:
      <code>
        switch(appState)
        {
            case TRY_MOUNT:
                if(SYS_FS_Mount("/dev/mmcblka1", "/mnt/myDrive", FAT, 0, NULL) != SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS)

      is the one it is expecting and then proceed as demonstrated in above example.

      If the client does not want to be notified when the mount/unmount
      operation has completed, it does not need to register a callback.

    Summary:
      Gets file status.

    Description:
      This function obtains information about a file associated with the file
      name, and populates the information in the structure pointed to by buf.
      This function can read the status of file regardless of whether a file is
      opened or not.

    Precondition:
      Prior to opening a file, the name of the volume on which the file resides
      should be known and the volume should be mounted.

    Parameters:
      fname   - Name of the file with the path and the volume name. The string
                of volume and file name has to be preceded by "/mnt/". Also,
                the volume name and file name has to be separated by a slash
                "/".
      buf     - pointer to SYS_FS_FSTAT structure.

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - File stat operation was successful.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - File stat operation was unsuccessful. The reason for
                           the failure can be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error.

    Example:

    Summary:
      Moves the file pointer by the requested offset.

    Description:
      This function sets the file pointer for a open file associated with the
      file handle, as follows:
      whence = SYS_FS_SEEK_SET - File offset is set to offset bytes from the
                                 beginning.
      whence = SYS_FS_SEEK_CUR - File offset is set to its current location
                                 plus offset.
      whence = SYS_FS_SEEK_END - File offset is set to the size of the file
                                 plus offset. The offset specified for this
                                 option should be negative for the file pointer
                                 to be valid.

      Trying to move the file pointer using SYS_FS_FileSeek, beyond the range
      of file will only cause the pointer to be moved to the last location of
      the file.

    Precondition:
      A valid file handle must be obtained before seeking a file.

    Parameters:
      handle    - A valid file handle obtained during file open.
      offset    - The number of bytes which act as file offset. This value
                  could be a positive or negative value.
      whence    - Type of File Seek operation as specified in
                  SYS_FS_FILE_SEEK_CONTROL.

    Returns:
      On success - The number of bytes by which file pointer is moved (0 or positive number)
      On Failure - (-1) If the chosen offset value was (-1), the success or
                   failure can be determined with SYS_FS_Error.

    Example:
      <code>
        SYS_FS_HANDLE fileHandle;

    Summary:

    Description:
      When a file system operation fails, the application can know the reason
      of failure by calling the SYS_FS_Error. This function only reports the

      handle, any errors happening inside such function calls could be reported
      using SYS_FS_Error function. Even for functions, which take handle as its
      input parameters, the SYS_FS_Error function can be used to report the
      type of error for cases where the passed handle itself is invalid.

    Precondition:
      This function has to be called immediately after a failure is observed
      while doing a file operation. Any subsequent failure will overwrite the

                directory will be populated after the SYS_FS_DirRead function
                returns successfully. If LFN is used, then the "lfname" member

                the file name(long file name)

                The file system supports 8.3 file name(Short File Name) and
                also long file name. 8.3 filenames are limited to at most eight
                characters, followed optionally by a filename extension
                consisting of a period . and at most three further characters.
                If the file name fits within the 8.3 limits then generally
                there will be no valid LFN for it.

                The stat structure's fname field will contain the SFN and if
                there is a valid LFN entry for the file then the long file name
                will be copied into lfname member of the structure.

                           successful.
                           End of the directory condition is indicated by

    Summary:
      Rewinds to the beginning of the directory.

    Description:
      This function rewinds the directory to the start. Once a search of
      directory or directory read is completed, the rewind function is used to
      begin searching the directory from the start.

    Precondition:
      A valid directory handle must be obtained before reading a directory.

    Parameters:
      handle     - directory handle obtained during directory open.

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - Directory rewind operation was successful.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - Directory rewind operation was unsuccessful. The
                           reason for the failure can be retrieved with
                           SYS_FS_Error or SYS_FS_FileError.

    Example:
      <code>

    Summary:
      Searches for a file or directory.

    Description:
      This function searches for the requested file or directory. The file or
      directory is specified in the attr parameter, which is of type
      SYS_FS_FILE_DIR_ATTR.

    Precondition:
      A valid directory handle must be obtained before searching the directory.

    Parameters:
      handle      - directory handle obtained during directory open.
      name        - name of file or directory needed to be searched.  The file
                    name can have wild card entries as follows:
                    * - Indicates the rest of the filename or extension can
                        vary (e.g. FILE.*)
                    ? - Indicates that one character in a filename can vary
                        (e.g. F?LE.T?T)
      attr        - Attribute of the name of type SYS_FS_FILE_DIR_ATTR. This
                    attribute specifies whether to search a file or a
                    directory. Other attribute types could also be specified.
      stat        - Empty structure of type SYS_FS_FSTAT, where the properties
                    of the file/directory will be populated. If LFN is used,
                    then the "lfname" member of the SYS_FS_FSTAT structure
                    should be initialized with address of suitable buffer.
                    Also, the "lfsize" should be initialized with the size of
                    buffer. Once the function returns, the buffer whose address
                    is held in "lfname" will have the file name (long file
                    name).

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - Indicates that the file or directory was found. The
                           stat parameter will contain information about the
                           file or directory.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - Indicates that the file or directory was not found.
                           The reason for the failure can be retrieved with
                           SYS_FS_Error or SYS_FS_FileError.

    Description:
      This function attempts to write nbyte bytes from the buffer pointed to by
      buf to the file associated with the file handle.

    Precondition:
      A valid file handle must be obtained before writing a file.

    Parameters:
      handle      - File handle obtained during file open.
      buf         - Pointer to buffer from which data is to be written
      nbyte       - Number of bytes to be written

    Description:
      This function truncates the file size to the current file read/write
      pointer. This function has no effect if the file read/write pointer is
      already pointing to end of the file.

    Precondition:
      A valid file handle has to be passed as input to the function. The file
      has to be opened in a mode where writes to file is possible (such as read
      plus or write mode).

    Parameters:
      handle - A valid handle which was obtained while opening the file.

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - File truncate operation was successful.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - File truncate operation was unsuccessful. The reason

    Summary:
    Formats a drive.

    Description:
    This function formats a logic drive (create a FAT file system on the
    logical drive), as per the format specified.

    If the logical drive that has to be formatted has been bound to any
    partition (1-4) by multiple partition feature, the FAT volume is created
    into the specified partition. The physical drive must have been partitioned
    prior to using this function.

    Precondition:
    At least one disk must be mounted. The physical drive must have already
    been partitioned.

    Parameters:
    drive         - Pointer to buffer which will hold the name of drive being
                    for which the format is to be done. If this string is
                    NULL, then then current drive will be formatted. It is
                    important to end the drive name with a "/".
    opt           - Specifies the structure holding format options. If a null
                    pointer is given, fat code gives the function all options in default
                    value. The format option structure has five members described below:
                    fmt     - Specifies combination of FAT type flags, SYS_FS_FORMAT.
                              These flags specify which FAT type to be created on the volume.
                              If two or more types are specified, one out of them will be
                              selected depends on the volume size and au_size.
                              The default value is FM_ANY.
                    au_size - Specifies size of the allocation unit (cluter) in unit of byte.
                              The valid value is power of 2 between sector size and
                              128 * sector size inclusive for FAT/FAT32 volume and up to 16 MB.
                              When a zero is given, the cluster size depends on the volume size.
                    n_align - Specifies alignment of the volume data area (file allocation pool,
                              usually erase block boundary of flash media) in unit of sector.
                              When a zero is given, alignment is decided on the block size.
                    n_fat   - Specifies number of FAT copies on the FAT/FAT32 volume.
                              Valid value for this member is 1 or 2. If the FAT type is exFAT,
                              this member has no effect.
                    n_root  - Specifies number of root directory entries on the FAT volume.
                              Valid value for this member is up to 32768 and aligned to
                              sector size / 32. If the FAT type is FAT32 or exFAT, this member
                              has no effect.
    work           - Pointer to the working buffer used for the format process.
    len            - Size of the working buffer in unit of byte. It needs to be the sector size
                     of the corresponding physical drive at least. Plenty of working buffer
                     reduces number of write transactions to the drive and the format process
                     will finish quickly.

    Returns:
    SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - Drive format was successful.
    SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - Drive format was unsucessful. The reason for the
                        failure can be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error.

    Summary:
      Partitions a physical drive (media).

    Description:
      This function partitions a physical drive (media) into requested
      partition sizes. This function will alter the MBR of the physical drive
      and make it into multi partitions. Windows operating systems do not
      support multi partitioned removable media. Maximum 4 partitions can be
      created on a media.

    Precondition:
      Prior to partitioning the media, the media should have a valid MBR and it
      should be mounted as a volume with the file system.

    Parameters:
      path      - Path to the volume with the volume name. The string of volume
                  name has to be preceded by "/mnt/". Also, the volume name and
                  directory name has to be separated by a slash "/".
      partition - Array with 4 items, where each items mentions the sizes of
                  each partition in terms of number of sector. 0th element of
                  array specifies the number of sectors for first partition and
                  3rd element of array specifies the number of sectors for
                  fourth partition.
      work      - Pointer to the buffer for function work area. The size must
                  be at least FAT_FS_MAX_SS bytes.

    Returns:
      SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS - Partition was successful.
      SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE - Partition was unsuccessful. The reason for the
                           failure can be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error.
