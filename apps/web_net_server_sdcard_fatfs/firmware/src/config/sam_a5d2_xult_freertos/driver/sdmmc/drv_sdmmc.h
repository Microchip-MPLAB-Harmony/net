/* SDMMC Driver command handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read or Write
    functions. This handle allows the application to track the completion
    of the operation. This command handle is also returned to the client
    along with the event that has occurred with respect to the command.
    This allows the application to connect the event to a specific
    command in case where multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command
    has been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

    None.

/* SDMMC Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a SDMMCDriver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SDMMC event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to
    receive event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write requests

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MySDMMCEventHandler
    (
        DRV_SDMMC_EVENT event,
        DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT* pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT* ) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer.
                break;

            case DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    write or a read operation was completed successfully.

    If the event is DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.

    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_SDMMC_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write
    request.

  Summary:
    Initializes the SD Card driver.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine initializes the SD Card driver, making it ready for clients to
    open and use the driver.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex        - Index for the driver instance to be initialized

    init            - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary
                      to initialize the driver. This pointer may be null if no
                      data is required because static overrides have been
                      provided.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver object. Otherwise, it
    returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_SDMMC_INIT      init;
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      objectHandle;

    // Populate the SD Card initialization structure

    objectHandle = DRV_SDMMC_Initialize(DRV_SDMMC_INDEX_0, (SYS_MODULE_INIT*)&init);
    if (objectHandle == SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID)

    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other SD Card routine is called.
    This routine should only be called once during system initialization.

    This routine will NEVER block for hardware access. The system must use
    DRV_SDMMC_Status to find out when the driver is in the ready state.

    Build configuration options may be used to statically override options in the
    "init" structure and will take precedence over initialization data passed
    using this routine.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking read operation for reading blocks
    of data from the SD Card. The function returns with a valid buffer handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the read request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns
    DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the
    following circumstances:
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the target buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the number of blocks to be read is zero or more than the actual number
      of blocks available
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the
    buffer was processed successfully or DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR
    event if the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SDMMC_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SDMMC
    driver instance.

    DRV_SDMMC_Open must have been called and a valid handle must have been obtained.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle

    targetBuffer  - Buffer into which the data read from the SD Card will be placed

    blockStart    - Start block address of the SD Card from where the read should begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be read.

  Returns:
    The buffer handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation for writing blocks
    of data to the SD Card. The function returns with a valid buffer handle

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle

    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed to the SD Card.

    blockStart    - Start block address of SD Card where the writes should begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be written.

  Returns:
    The buffer handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be

    handle has expired. A command handle expires when the internal buffer object
    is re-assigned to another read or write request. It is recommended that this
    function be called regularly in order to track the command status correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive read or
    write operation completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_SDMMC_Initialize routine must have been called.

    The DRV_SDMMC_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_STATUS value describing the current status of the command.
    Returns DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the client handle or the command
    handle is not valid.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE                    handle;         // Returned from DRV_SDMMC_Open
    DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE      commandHandle;
    DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_STATUS      status;

    status = DRV_SDMMC_CommandStatus(handle, commandHandle);
    if(status == DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_COMPLETED)
    {
        // Operation Done
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This routine will not block for hardware access and will immediately return
    the current status.

        const DRV_HANDLE handle,
        const void* eventHandler,
        const uintptr_t context
    );

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when queued operation has completed.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.
    When a client queues a request for a read or a write operation, it is provided
    with a handle identifying the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler"
    function when the queued operation has completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any read or write
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which could
    be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SDMMC_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SDMMC driver instance.

    The DRV_SDMMC_Open routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the user

    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint32_t blockStart, nBlock;
    DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle;

    // drvSDMMCHandle is the handle returned
    // by the DRV_SDMMC_Open function.

    // Client registers an event handler with driver. This is done once.

    DRV_SDMMC_EventHandlerSet(drvSDMMCHandle, APP_SDMMCEventHandler, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj);

    DRV_SDMMC_AsyncRead(drvSDMMCHandle, &commandHandle, &myBuffer[0], blockStart, nBlock);

    if(commandHandle == DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event Processing Technique. Event is received when operation is done.

    void APP_SDMMCEventHandler(
        DRV_SDMMC_EVENT event,
        DRV_SDMMC_COMMAND_HANDLE handle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        // The context handle was set to an application specific
        // object. It is now retrievable easily in the event handler.

        MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj = (MY_APP_OBJ* ) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // This means the data was transferred successfully
                break;

            case DRV_SDMMC_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:

                // Error handling here

            default:
                break;
        }
    }

  Remarks:
    If the client does not want to be notified when the queued operation
    has completed, it does not need to register a callback.
