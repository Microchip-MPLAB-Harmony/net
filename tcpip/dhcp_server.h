  Summary:
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) Server APIs.

  Description:
     The DHCP server module implements the 'RFC 2131 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol' standard.
     It assigns an IP address to a requesting DHCP client.
     The server address range is defined when the module is configured.
 
     Some of the known issues and implementation limitations:
        - there is no support for multiple sub-net pools
        - Operation for clients using relay agents may be impacted
            The server will assign a lease in the server network,
            not in the relay agent 'down link' network

  Summary:
    Registers a DHCP server Handler.

  Description:
    This function registers a DHCP event handler.
    The DHCP module will call the registered handler when a
    DHCP event (TCPIP_DHCPS_EVENT_TYPE) occurs.

  Precondition:
    The DHCPs module must be initialized.

  Parameters:
    hNet    - Interface handle.
              Use hNet == 0 to register on all interfaces available.
    handler - Handler to be called when a DHCP event occurs.
    hParam  - Parameter to be used in the handler call.
              This is user supplied and is not used by the DHCP module.


  Returns:
    Returns a valid handle if the call succeeds, or a null handle if
    the call failed (out of memory, for example).

  Remarks:
    The handler has to be short and fast. It is meant for
    setting an event flag, not for lengthy processing!

    The hParam is passed by the client and will be used by the DHCP when the
    notification is made. It is used for per-thread content or if more modules,
    for example, share the same handler and need a way to differentiate the
