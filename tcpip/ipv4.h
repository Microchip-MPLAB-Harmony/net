    IP is the workhorse protocol of the TCP/IP protocol suite. All TCP,

/* IPv4 Fowarding Support
 *
 *  The IPv4 module contains support for packet forwarding/routing using a forwarding table
 *
 * Note that this is NOT an implementation of a full router machine!
 * There are features requested by the RFC 1812 that are not supported.
 * Some of the missing features will be eventually added.
 * This is work in progress.
 *
 *  Some of the known issues and implementation limitations:
 *  - the forwarding table is strictly static. There are no routing protocols running
 *    to allow the dynamic update of the table
 *  - the forwarding table is populated when the IPv4 module is initialized:
 *    the table is part of the configuration data
 *  - API will be added to add/remove table entries at run time
 *    Currently this is not supported
 *  - When forwarding a packet from one interface to another, packet fragmentation is not yet supported
 *  - Forwading  of multicast packets is not currently supported
 *  - A packet can be both processed on the host and forwarded
 *    (which should be possible for mcast or directed broadcast, for example)
 *    Supported for broadcast only.
 *  - Virtual IPv4 interfaces are not yet supported
 *  - Currently the search of the forwarding table is purely sequential!
 *    A better algorithm will be eventually provided.
 *  - There is no provision to update the table at run time when the host obtains
 *    an IP address from a DHCP server, for example.
 *    As a router, probably the address should be static and not received
 *    from another DHCP server
 *  - Source Route Option is not examined/processed in the incoming packets
 *  - Source Route Option is not supported in the forwarded packets
 *  - ICMP messages are not generated
 *  - TOS field is not considered in the packet forwarding
 *  - Source Address Validation is not (yet) supported

/* IPv4 fowarding entry

  Summary:
    Defines an entry in the IPv4 forwarding table 
    using ASCII strings for the network addresses

  Description:
    Describes an IPV4 forwarding table entry.
    The forwading table contains multiple forwarding entries.
    Usually the router machine refers to the information in the
    forwarding table as the Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
    The IPv4 module constructs a forwarding table for each interface.
    The initial contents of the forwarding table is specified
    using the IPv4 configuration data.


    The forwarding table is used as follows:

    Internally the forwarding table is ordered based on the number of bits set to 1 in the network mask:
    the higher the number of bits set in the mask, the higher the priority of the forwarding entry.
    If two entries have the same number of set mask bits, then the entry with a lower metric
    has the higher priority.
    For example, the entry with the mask '255.255.255.255' has higher priority
    than the entry with the mask '255.255.255.0'.
    The entry with mask '0.0.0.0' has the lowest priority and is the default entry that will match everything.

    For an incoming IPv4 packet on a specific interface, with a destination address destAddr
    - if the destAddr is the address of a local interface on the current host
      the packet will be processed internally and not forwarded
    - else the forwarding table entries for the input interface are traversed from the highest priority to the lowest
      and a match is searched for, such that:
            destAddr & entry->netMask == entry->netAddress
       When the match occurred, the packet will be forwarded on the output interface
       specified by the entry->outIfName, following the rules:
            - if entry->gwAddress != 0, the packet will be sent to that gateway address
            - else if the destination is on that LAN
                the packet will be forwarded to that destination 
            - Otherwise the packet is not routable and it will be discarded.
    
    Example - we have a dual Ethernat interface host:
        if0 == 192.168.1.136/24 on LAN0
        if1 == 192.168.2.29/24 on LAN1
    The networks are on different LANs and we want to be able to forward some IPv4 traffic
    from one LAN segment to the other.

    Forwarding table example:
    forwardTable[] = 
    {
        Network         Mask             Gateway        inputInterface  outInterface
        // interface 0 entries    
        {192.168.2.240, 255.255.255.255, 0,             eth0,           eth1},       // traffic received on LAN0 for host 192.168.2.240 goes directly to it on LAN1
        {192.168.2.0,   255.255.255.0,   0,             eth0,           eth1},       // traffic received on LAN0 for hosts on LAN1 goes to LAN1 over interface eth1 directly to that host
                                                                                     // Note that this entry makes the previous one unncecessary
        {192.168.3.0,   255.255.255.0,   192.168.2.1,   eth0,           eth1},       // traffic received for hosts on network 192.168.3.0/24 goes to LAN1 over interface eth1 using router 192.168.2.1
        // default entry; will match everything
        {0.0.0.0,       0.0.0.0,         192.168.1.100, eth0,           eth0},       // default entry; will match everything:
                                                                                     // all other traffic on LAN0  will be sent on eth0 to router 192.168.1.100 
        // interface 1 entries    
        {192.168.1.147, 255.255.255.255, 0,             eth1,           eth0},       // traffic received on LAN1 for host 192.168.1.147 goes directly to it on LAN0
        {192.168.1.0,   255.255.255.0,   192.168.1.100, eth1,           eth0},       // traffic received on LAN1 for hosts on LAN0 goes to LAN0 over interface eth0 using router 192.168.1.100
    }


  Remarks:
    A default route is usually provided as part of the IPv4 initialization.
    Note that if no match is found in the forwarding table
    the packet will be discarded and not forwarded

    RFC 1812 specifies that the packets that have as destination one of the LANs 
    directly connected to the router should be delivered without consulting the forwarding table.
    This implementation uses the forwarding table even in this case, as it is believed that this adds
    more flexibility, allowing the user to configure more specific rules for the forwarding.

  Summary:
    Pointer to a function(handler) that will get called to process an incoming IPv4 packet.

  Description:
    Pointer to a function that will be called by the IPv4 module
    when a RX packet is available.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    hNet        - network handle on which the packet has arrived
    rxPkt       - pointer to incoming packet
    hParam      - user passed parameter when handler was registered

  Returns:
    true - if the packet is processed by the external handler.
           In this case the IPv4 module will no longer process the packet
    false - the packet needs to be processed internally by the IPv4 as usual           

  Remarks:
    The packet handler is called in the IPv4 context.
    The handler should be kept as short as possible as it affects the processing of all the other
    IPv4 RX traffic.

    Before calling the external packet handler 
    - the rxPkt->pNetLayer points to an IPV4_HEADER data structure.
    - the rxPkt->pktIf points to the interface receiving the packet
    - no other checks are done! (checksum, versions, etc.)

    Important!
    When the packet handler returns true, once it's done processing the packet,
    it needs to acknowledge it, i.e. return to the owner,
    which is the MAC driver serving the network interface!
    This means that the packet acknowledge function needs to be called,
    with a proper acknowledge parameter and the QUEUED flag needs to be cleared, if needed:
    if((*rxPkt->ackFunc)(rxPkt, rxPkt->ackParam))
    {
           rxPkt->pktFlags &= ~TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED;
    }
    Failure to do that will result in memory leaks and starvation of the MAC driver.
    See the tcpip_mac.h for details.

  Summary:
    Sets a new packet processing handler.

  Description:
    This function registers a new packet processing handler.
    The caller can use the handler to be notified of incoming packets
