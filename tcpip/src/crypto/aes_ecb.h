 v1.0   Original release - released with AN1044

 v2.0   Updated to support 192-bit and 256-bit modes.  API change to be
        compatible with PIC32 implementation.  This increases RAM usage but
        decreases the decode time.

    The AES_ECB_STATE_DATA structure contains state information that needs to be
    retained between blocks of ECB data.  This structure is also used to pass
    some initialization data to the first block of a new stream.

  Function:
    void AESECBEncrypt( uint8_t *cipher_text,
                        uint32_t *num_cipher_bytes,
                        uint8_t *plain_text,

                        uint32_t options
                      )

  Summary:
    Encrypts a specified amount of data using Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.
  Description:
    Encrypts a specified amount of data using Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.

  Precondition:
      * Round keys must be create by AESCreateRoundKeys() before calling
        this routine.
      * p_cbc_state_data->round_keys must be set to point to a buffer
        containing the round keys for this session.  This buffer must
        maintain the round keys until this session is complete.  The round
        keys can be created using the AESCreateRoundKeys() function.

  Parameters:
    cipher_text     - [out] pointer to the buffer where the encrypted data should reside.  This buffer must be a multiple of 16 bytes even if the plain text passed in is not.  It must also be larger than or equal to the plain_text buffer.
    num_cipher_bytes - [out] the number of bytes written to the cipher_text buffer.  Note that this could be more or less than the num_plain_bytes due to buffered data or padding.
    plain_text      - [in]  pointer to the data that needs to be encrypted.
    num_plain_bytes - [in]  the number of bytes in the plain_text buffer
    round_keys  - [in] pointer to the round key buffer that will be used
                  for this encryption cycle.
    p_ecb_state_data      - [in]  pointer to an instance of the AES_ECB_STATE_DATA for this stream.  The first call of this function should have the p_ecb_state_data->round_keys pointing to the set of round keys created by the AESCreateRoundKeys() function.
    options         - [in]  Set of options that are ORed together (e.g. - AES_PAD_NONE | AES_STREAM_START).  Valid options are\: 
                            * AES_PAD_NONE
                            * AES_PAD_NULLS
                            * AES_PAD_8000
                            * AES_PAD_NUMBER
                            * AES_STREAM_START
                            * AES_STREAM_COMPLETE
                            * AES_STREAM_CONTINUE
                            * AES_CIPHER_TEXT_POINTER_ALIGNED
                            * AES_PLAIN_TEXT_POINTER_ALIGNED
  Returns:
    None
