// TCP Maximum Segment Size for TX.  The TX maximum segment size is actually 
// governed by the remote node's MSS option advertised during connection 
// establishment.  However, if the remote node specifies an unmanageably large 
// MSS (ex: > Ethernet MTU), this define sets a hard limit so that TX buffers 
// are not overflowed.  If the remote node does not advertise a MSS 
// option, all TX segments are fixed at 536 bytes maximum.
// This symbol sets an upper bound on the TCP MSS on the transmit side
// which can ignore/override the remote node advertising.

// When large TX bufferrs are needed, probably a dynamic, per socket approach,
// is a better choice (see TCPIP_TCP_OptionsSet function).
// The performance of a socket is highly dependent on the size of its buffers
// so it's a good idea to use as large as possible buffers for the sockets that need
// high throughput.
