/* Read Data Start

    Summary:
    Read data from the ENC hardware.

    Details:
    This function reads data from the ENC. The parameters to this function are a
    little different than expected.  The TCP/IP packet segment is allocated with
    some space before the actual pointer in the packet.  For the PIC32 Internal
    MAC this is two bytes.  This data is used by the MAC for its own purposes.
    n the case of the ENC28J60 only 1 byte is needed for SPI.  For PSP a
    different number may be needed.  The buffer that is passed in is the start
    of the data segment, and this function assumes there is some allocated space
    before the pointer.  The datasize is the size of the data portion, not the
    total size of the buffer.

    Preconditions:
    The bus had to have been initialized first.

    Parameters
        pDrvInstance – The driver instance
        reg – the register to write to
        buffer – the location of the buffer to write
        dataSize – the size of the data to read.

    Returns:
        0 – on error
        Valid handle – on success
