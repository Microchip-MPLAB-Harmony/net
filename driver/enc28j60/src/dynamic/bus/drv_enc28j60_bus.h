        A TCPIP_MAC_RES result:
        TCPIP_MAC_RES_PENDING if retry needed
        TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK if operation went through
        TCPIP_MAC_RES_PACKET_ERR - rejected, cannot transmit such packet
        
        

    Remarks:
        The SPI driver does not currently support write operations with multiple linked segments 
        (this feature is needed because each data segment has to start with an WBM command to the ENC).
        Thus the zero copy functionality of the TCP/IP stack cannot be used for this driver when
        a packet consists of multiple segments.
        In this case a copy is done to an internal buffer that is transmitted over the SPI wire.

/* Read Data Start

    Summary:
    Read data from the ENC hardware.  

    Details:
    This function reads data from the ENC. The parameters to this function are a 
    little different than expected.  The TCP/IP packet segment is allocated with 
    some space before the actual pointer in the packet.  For the PIC32 Internal 
    MAC this is two bytes.  This data is used by the MAC for its own purposes.  
    n the case of the ENC28J60 only 1 byte is needed for SPI. The buffer that 
	is passed in is the start of the data segment, and this function assumes 
	there is some allocated space before the pointer.  The datasize is the size
	of the data portion, not the total size of the buffer.

    Preconditions:
    The bus had to have been initialized first.
    
    Parameters
        pDrvInstance – The driver instance
        reg – the register to write to
        buffer – the location of the buffer to write
        dataSize – the size of the data to read.

    Returns:
        0 – on error
        Valid handle – on success
